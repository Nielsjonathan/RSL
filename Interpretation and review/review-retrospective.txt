The results that I got from the SQL and Python recommender systems was nice. I will use those lists if I want to find another movie to watch in the future!


I enjoyed working with the booklet very much. It gave the right amount of support to get you to the end result while still making you do most of the work.
It would be nice if the booklet can be updated to also give the same level of instructions for the python part. 
The python part for me was a lot more difficult since I have no previous experience with that.
