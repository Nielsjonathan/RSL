Results interpretation.

I don't really remember what I filled in as my favorite movie during the introduction week.
I am quite sure it was a movie by Christopher Nolan but since I heard that many other people also have Inception or Insterstallar
I picked a movie by Nolan that is less know called Memento. I used this movie for my recommender system.

SQL part:

I get recommendations based on summary, title and starring. I explain my results here briefly.

Summary: the movies that I get recommended here are based on the summary of the movie Memento. I am glad to see Interstellar as the best match since I like that movie very much and I can understand that the system recommends this.
Title: I don't get any recommendations here because there are no other movies in the dataset with the word Memento in the title. So this output makes sense.
Starring: I get some good recommendations here based on the actors in the movie Memento. I think these recommendations are very nice because I like the actors in Memento! I know now what other movies they play in.

Python part:

I tested the code by using "beach rats" this movie only has 3 authors so it doesn't take ages to compute.
Once I got it working I changed beach rats to Memento. Computing this took 105 minutes because there are many authors that rated Memento. 
I will have to see how I can make this code run faster in the future.

The recommendations from the python script give me many good movies to watch and I really like that output gives me a list of movies to watch in the future :)
