The powerfully understated performance as the loner who finds happiness with the family next door is fantastically delivered. A man who seems to consider the necessity of each and every word he speaks, the scenes where Gosling and Carey Mulligans relationship develops through the briefest of exchanges and longest of stares are particularly mesmerising with director Nicholas Refn stretching the scenes of the silence to the absolute limit before with the viewer feeling awkward.

He simply follows them around during dramatic scenes and uses cinematic symbolism to show the mood. The script jumps through twists and turns until you feel happy and sad at the same time.

Receiving twelve Academy Award nominations, and again winning Best Picture (and this time Best Director for Coppola as well), the second installment has been rightfully hailed as the best sequel of all time."", """", ""The Godfather Part II is a more ambitious production than the original since it attempts not only to tell a pair of completely disconnected stories, but to do so in parallel. The less time consuming of the two presents the early life of Vito Corleone (played by Robert DeNiro) in Sicily and New York, and shows how he came into power. The other tale picks up approximately a decade after the conclusion of The Godfather, and shows the means by which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now secure in his position, attempts to expand the family empire into Las Vegas and Cuba."", """", ""Michael lives his life and runs his business by two of his father's creeds: \""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man\"" and \""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\"" There are times, however, when those precepts fail as guiding principles, such as when a betrayal occurs from within the family. Broken trust arising from so intimate a source can be devastating."", """", ""Plot and counterplot develop, and Michael becomes the focal point of a web of betrayal and deceit, turned against by those he had sought to protect. Assassination attempts and government probes target Michael, but he fights back using every scintilla of ingenuity he possesses and sacrificing much of his humanity in the process."", """", ""For a man constantly battling to keep his family together, a mournful irony of The Godfather Part II is that Michael's efforts succeed only in fragmenting it. If the end of the first film was numbing, this one is shattering. The flashback preceding the final scene presents a stark differentiation of how things once were from what they have become."", """", ""The traditional elements of the Tragedy introduced in The Godfather reach their maturity in Part II. Much of the humanity remaining to Michael at the outset is leeched from him with each deception and setback. Late scenes with a resentful Fredo (John Cazale) and a bitter Kay (Diane Keaton) emphasize the price for Michael of continuing his father's dominion. His flaw is his imperceptiveness and, as is the case for any hero in a story of this nature, its effects are crippling."", """", ""Primarily due to the scope of events, Part II is not as tightly-scripted as Part I. While most of the first film takes place in New York (with a few excursions elsewhere), here the settings vary: Sicily, Ellis Island, New York, Nevada, Cuba, Miami, Washington DC. In letting their characters escape the confines of the \""old neighborhood\"", Coppola and Puzo lessen the intimacy of certain interpersonal conflicts."", """", ""Visually, many of Michael's scenes have a more gloomy appearance this time around. Especially during the latter portions of the film, the don is shown in severely underexposed settings, appearing as a silhouette. His is a voice from the darkness - a photographic mirror of what's happening beneath the surface."", """", ""As the beginning of Part II echoes the opening of The Godfather, so too does the end. Because of the manner in which circumstances are handled and considering the people involved, the impact here is more forceful. The tragic flaw has accomplished its poisonous, inevitable designs. Coppola punctuates both movies with a gut-twisting exclamation point."", """", ""Combined, The Godfather and The Godfather Part II represent the apex of American movie-making and the ultimate gangster story. Few sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and detail of this one. Beneath the surface veneer of an ethnic period piece, The Godfather is not so much about crime lords as it is about prices paid in the currency of the soul for decisions made and avoided. It is that quality which establishes this saga as timeless."" ]";9

Without a doubt, one of those is Stanley Kubrik's 1964 masterpiece, Dr. Strangelove (or, as it's subtitled, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb). As political satire, few movies -- even those as incisive as the hilariously vicious 1992 release Bob Roberts -- come close to this level of accomplishment. In the case of Dr. Strangelove, the barbs and quips (both subtle and obvious) hold up as well today as they did thirty years ago."", """", ""When director Stanley Kubrick decided to adapt Peter George's thriller Red Alert for the screen, he recruited the author to help with the script. Instead of retaining the straight tone of the book, Kubrick wanted to try for a black comedy, and with the complicity of George and co-writer Terry Southern, Dr. Strangelove was born."", """", ""Originally, Kubrick envisioned Peter Sellers playing four unique roles. However, after filming three of them (President Merkin Muffley, RAF Group Captain Mandrake, and ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove), the actor broke his leg and was unable to complete the quartet. In his place, Slim Pickens was signed to portray Major \""King\"" Kong. Other cast members include George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson, Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper, and James Earl Jones (in his first film role) as Lieutenant Lothar Zogg."", """", ""As a story chronicling the potential countdown to humanity's end in a nuclear fireball, Dr. Strangelove is tightly-plotted and well-paced. As a black comedy, wielding a wit sharper than honed steel, the film is unparalleled. Kubrick's picture has so many targets that it's difficult to know where to begin. Certainly, the \""balance of power\"" nuclear deterrent policy gets the most obvious jabs (although ardent supporters may not see this -- Dr. Strangelove's attacks are subtle enough that it's possible for an unsophisticated viewer to miss the point). Parodying the \""missile gap\"" at the heart of the arms race, we are given the \""doomsday gap\"" and the \""mine shaft gap.\"""", """", ""Kubrick isn't especially kind to the military mentality, as personified by General Turgidson (elements of Scott's performance here foreshadow how he would approach the role of Patton in the 1970 movie that earned him an Oscar). Turgidson sees Soviet plots everywhere, flirts with a girlfriend in the midst of a national crisis, believes 10-20 million American casualties (tops!) are acceptable, and wishes the U.S. had some sort of doomsday machine to match the Russians' capabilities."", """", ""As the film races to its conclusion, situations become more bizarre, with a drunk Soviet Premier Kissoff whining over the phone to Muffley that the U.S. planes are flying too low and jamming his radar. Mandrake tries to put an emergency call through to the President, but the Pentagon won't accept the collect call, and he doesn't have exact change. And Dr. Strangelove, Hitler's best living ally, comes up with a plan to preserve the superior elements of humanity."", """", ""The genius of Dr. Strangelove is that it's possible to laugh -- and laugh hard -- while still recognizing the intelligence and insight behind the humor. The film is always saying something, and a viewer would have to be deaf and blind not to recognize the targets of the sarcasm. In fact, I'd worry about anyone who takes this movie too seriously. That, after all, isn't the kind of person Dr. Strangelove is aimed for; it's the kind this film takes aim at."" ]";9

As a result, in deciding to film Schindler's List, director Steven Spielberg (Jurassic Park) set an imposing task for himself. His vision needed to differ from that of the film makers who preceded him, yet the finished product had to remain faithful to the unforgettable images which represent the legacy of six million massacred Jews. Those who see this motion picture will witness Spielberg's success."", """", ""Spielberg elected to film this motion picture in black-and-white, and it's impossible to argue with his choice. Director of Photography Janusz Kaminski has made effective use of shadow and light, meticulously limiting the application of hue. The opening scene is in color, as is the closing sequence (which features the surviving \""Schindler Jews\"", each accompanied by the actor who played their character, placing a stone on their savior's grave). There are also two instances when color is allowed to bleed into the blacks, whites, and grays. One little girl's jacket appears red so that she stands out from the masses, and a pair of candles burn with orange flames. When color is used, it makes a point and an impression."", """", ""Often, the experiences of the minor characters provide the most lasting images. Helen's story is memorable, as is the plight of young Danka Dresner and her mother as they strive to avoid death while staying together. There's a Jewish couple that marries in the Plaszow camp, even though their chances of survival are dim, and a Rabbi who survives a close encounter with a Nazi gun."", """", ""Of course the Holocaust images are grim, but scenes of mass graves and exhumed bodies are not unique to Schindler's List. While it's impossible to deny their power, potentially more distubing are the instances of callous, individual murder. Spielberg doesn't spare his audience when it comes to sudden violence or the dehumanizing factors involved in such events. After all, Jews were viewed as \""vermin.\"" Schindler's List is replete with moments like this."", """", ""The acting is uniformly excellent. Liam Neeson's Schindler is shown in all his complexity, and his transformation is played with studied control. This is no sudden reversal of philosophy, but a matter of conscience that slowly dawns on the man. With a keen sense of Schindler's character, Neeson depicts the metamorphosis from self-centered businessman to driven messiah."", """", ""Despite the grisly subject matter, this movie is essentially about uncovering a kernel of hope and dignity in the midst of a monstrous tragedy. The story of Oskar Schindler's sacrifices for the Jews sets this apart from other Holocaust dramas. Uncompromising in its portrayal of good, evil, and all the shades in between, Schindler's List offers a clear view of human nature laid bare: hatred, greed, lust, envy, anger, and, most important of all, empathy and love. Because this film touches us so deeply, the catharsis has a power that few -- if any -- other moments in film history can match. And that's what establishes this as a transcendent motion picture experience."" ]";9

There can be no greater gift for a movie lover than the one bestowed upon audiences by Peter Jackson, whose The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not only the best movie of 2003, but the crowning cinematic achievement of the past several years. In fact, labeling this as a \""movie\"" is almost an injustice. This is an experience of epic scope and grandeur, amazing emotional power, and relentless momentum."", """", ""One could be forgiven for initially approaching The Return of the King with a little trepidation. As good as the first two films, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, are (in either their theatrical or extended DVD versions), movie history is littered with occasions when trilogy conclusions have crashed and burned. Return of the Jedi. Godfather III. The Matrix Revolutions. And so on? Yet, with The Return of the King, Jackson has done more than just bucked the trend. Not only is this motion picture an entirely worthy conclusion to the landmark trilogy, but it's better than its predecessors. Somehow, Jackson has managed to synthesize what worked in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, while siphoning off the less successful elements. The result is amazing. Taken as a whole, there is nothing out there today that can come close to comparing to The Lord of the Rings."", """", ""The slowest portions of The Return of the King occur early in the proceedings, as Jackson re-establishes the characters. From there, it's a slow, steady buildup to a rousing climax. The experience is so immersive that I found myself in the middle of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields along with the heroes, rooting for them - even though I knew how things were going to turn out! Along the way, there are moments of genuine pathos that draw a tear from the eye; times of triumph that cause the heart to soar; instances of overwhelming tension that cause the adrenaline to surge; and images of spectacle that make the jaw drop. The pace is unflagging - once Jackson has us, he doesn't let go. When the movie was over, I couldn't believe that 3 1/4 hours had passed."", """", ""Although it's unfair to characterize the film as a collection of great moments - the character arcs and overall narrative are too strong for that - it is nevertheless impossible to deny the power of many individual scenes. One of Jackson's most notable contributions is that he directs the film with the intention that certain instances will raise nape hairs. It's the \""wow\"" factor, and it is frequently repeated. Gene Siskel once argued that a great film needs three memorable scenes to go along with no bad ones. The Return of the King exceeds that criteria by a considerable amount."", """", ""For those who despise truncated endings, Jackson has a treat in store. The Return of the King ends with a 20 minute epilogue that chronicles events after the War of the Ring, going as much as four years into the future and tying up nearly every possible loose end. The film concludes on exactly the same note as the book (in fact, with the same line), and, while the final chapter of the trilogy is as satisfying as it could possibly be, there's still a vague sense of melancholy when \""The End\"" appears on the screen, because it means that these adventures are over."", """", ""Expectedly, the special effects set a new standard. The CGI participants of the major battles look more like real combatants than cartoonish computer creations. The locations, set design, and costumes are without flaw. By building many of the elaborate locales, Jackson achieves a sense of verisimilitude that he might not have attained by relying more heavily on computers. And composer Howard Shore's score is perfectly wed to the visuals, being alternately bombastic and delicate, as circumstances dictate."", """", ""Leaving Middle Earth, Jackson is now headed for Skull Island and a remake of King Kong that already has me excited. He has not ruled out a return to this fantasy world - he would like to make The Hobbit with some of the same actors, if the complicated rights issues surrounding the prequel can be straightened out. In the meantime, he has given us a trilogy of films to savor and remember. The Lord of the Rings will go down in cinematic lore as a milestone. It has legitimatized fantasy like no other production and has shown that it is possible for studio executives to realize huge gains when taking huge risks. (Had The Lord of the Rings failed, New Line Cinema would have gone down with it.) History will show the importance of The Lord of the Rings. The present illustrates its broad appeal and undeniable critical and commercial success. For many, the release of The Return of the King is the event of the year. And this is one time when the product is good enough to weather the storm of hype. This ring is golden."" ]";9

I'm perfectly capable of going to the \""R\"" section for Raiders rather than having it alongside the sequels, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."", """", ""You have to love a movie that is so devilishly clever as to make the hero's every effort, no matter how Herculean, irrelevant to the conclusion. Had Dr. Jones elected to go on an extended vacation to Mozambique and never have anything to do with the Ark of the Covenant, nothing would have changed. Jones doesn't save the day. In fact, he doesn't come close to rescuing it, unless one considers his having failed as being the key to success. (Although he does get the girl.) Yes, the movie ends with melting faces, but, underneath all of that liquefying flesh and exploding heads, there's an abundance of irony just waiting for the attentive movie-goer to unearth. When was the last time that an action hero has been so utterly, completely inconsequential as Indiana Jones?"", """", ""But, in discussing the ending, I'm getting ahead of myself. Better, instead, to go back to the beginning. Where that is, is anyone's guess. It could be back in the late '40s, when a young George Lucas was enthralled by the cliffhanger serials that would inspire this film. It could be in 1975, when Steven Spielberg made a little movie about a not-so-little shark and suddenly became a big name in Hollywood. It could be in 1977 when Lucas' Star Wars singlehandedly revived science fiction and solidified the concept of the summer blockbuster. Or it could be later in that same year, when Lucas and Spielberg, while both vacationing in Hawaii, decided that they had to work together on a project. That project would become Raiders of the Lost Ark."", """", ""Action movies were a different breed in the pre-1981 years than they are today, and one of the reasons for their transformation had to do with Raiders of the Lost Ark. Before this movie, James Bond ruled the roost and the Bond formula was the accepted path that any self-respecting action movie would follow. The first Indiana Jones outing changed that. The film was constructed as a series of cliffhangers with narrow, death-defying escapes. Not since the era of serials have audiences so often asked the question, \""How's he going to get out of this one?\"" It's unfair to claim that the 007 outings were unexciting, but, compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark, they come across as sedate. Raiders transformed the action movie landscape. In the years that followed, nearly every action movie would try to generate the same sense of suspense and tension. Even the Bond movies would catch on."", """", ""Certainly, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a breathless, white-knuckle experience of a movie. It is also perfectly paced. There's enough time in between the frequent action scenes to provide the minimum of exposition and character development for us to understand what's going on and to appreciate the relationships between the individuals who populate the screen. There's none of the frantic quick-cutting that has since become a staple of action movies (thank you, editor Michael Kahn!), and the production does not seem frenzied and out-of-control. This isn't a case of cardboard figures running around in circles and blowing things up. We care about Indy and Marion in ways that we rarely care about protagonists in this genre. When Marion \""dies,\"" it stings."", """", ""For composer John Williams, who has long been favored by both Spielberg and Lucas, the chance to work on Raiders of the Lost Ark offered him an opportunity to collaborate with them both, and to add another memorable theme song to his list of credits. In the five-year period from 1977 to 1982, Williams created five of movie-dom's most popular title tracks: Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and E.T."", """", ""The deserved popularity of Raiders of the Lost Ark resulted in a huge box office bonanza for Paramount Pictures. This is the kind of movie that, even today, audiences immediately fall in love with. It has all the right ingredients: a smart script, a likable hero, a dash of romance, more than a touch of comedy, and a lot of fast-paced action. The two sequels are vastly inferior - Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is too ponderous and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is unforgivably fatuous. Yet, because the first entry of the series leaves such an indelible imprint, the existence of lesser chapters to the Indiana Jones saga does nothing to dilute its impact. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a movie to be savored by viewers of all ages and all persuasions."" ]";9

In a time when so few motion pictures leave an impact, Fight Club refuses to be ignored or dismissed. The experience lingers, demanding to be pondered and considered, and, unlike 95% of modern-day thrillers, there is a great deal here to think about and argue over. Fight Club presents an overload of thought-provoking material that works on so many levels as to offer grist for the mills of thousands of reviews, feature articles, and post-screening conversations."", """", ""Pre-release interest in Fight Club was understandably high, primarily because of those involved with the project. Jim Uhls' script is based on an influential novel by Chuck Palahniuk (a book that, while not required material in schools, has consumed the free time of countless readers). The lead actor is the ever-popular Brad Pitt, who makes his strongest bid to date to shed his pretty boy image and don the mantle of a serious thespian. Those dubious about Pitt's ability to pull this off in the wake of his recent attempts in Seven Years in Tibet (which is briefly referenced as an in-joke during Fight Club) and Meet Joe Black will suffer a change of heart after seeing this film. Pitt's male co-star, Edward Norton, is widely recognized as one of the most intelligent and versatile performers of his generation. And Fight Club's director, David Fincher, has already made a huge artistic impression on movie-goers with only three features to his credit: Alien 3, Seven (starring Pitt), and The Game. Mix these elements together in Fox's publicity blender, and Fight Club will not carry the title of \""Best Movie of 1999 That No One Saw.\"""", """", ""Told in a conventional fashion, Fight Club would still have been engaging. However, Fincher's gritty, restless style turns it into a visual masterpiece. The overall experience is every bit as surreal as watching Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. This is a tale that unfolds in an eerie alternate universe where the melodies of life have the same rhythm as in ours but are in a different key. Fincher also shows just enough restraint that his flourishes seem like important parts of the storytelling method instead of gimmicks. And there are a lot of them. In one scene, a character's apartment is laid out like a page in a furniture catalog, complete with text blurbs superimposed on the screen describing the various pieces. There are occasional single frame interruptions that flash by so quickly that they may pass unnoticed. The film opens with a truly inventive close-up - one that literally gets under the skin. Also in play: a non-linear chronology, a voiceover by a narrator who might not be entirely reliable, frequent breaking of the fourth wall, and an occasional freeze-frame. As was true of Fincher's other three films, Fight Club is dark and fast-paced. There's not a lot of time for introspection. One could call this MTV style, but, unlike many equally frantic movies, there's a reason for each quick cut beyond preventing viewers from becoming bored."", """", ""In A Clockwork Orange, Kubrick depicted the actions of the Droogs but did not condone it. This is Fincher's approach in Fight Club. As the film progresses, he systematically reveals each new turn in an ever-deepening spiral that descends into darkness and madness. There's also a heavy element of satire and black comedy. Macabre humor can be found everywhere, from the pithy quips traded by Jack and Tyler to the way Jack interacts with his boss. When combined together, the satire, violence, and unpredictable narrative make a lasting and forceful statement about modern-day society. It's a timely message that hints at why there are post office shootings and kids in schools killing their fellow students. By blaming movies like Fight Club for real-life horrors, politicians want us to look at the world through rose-colored glasses that they have tinted. Instead, Fincher offers a clear, uncompromising portrait that disturbs because it is perceptive and defies the facile answers proffered by elected officials. Movies are not to blame. Guns are not to blame. People and the society that has spawned and stifled them are."", """", ""It remains to be seen whether Fight Club will generate any Oscars. The strength of the writing, direction, and acting justifies a stream of nominations, but quality has never been the driving factor in who is recognized by the Academy. Regardless of how it is received in February, when the nominations are announced, Fight Club is a memorable and superior motion picture - a rare movie that does not abandon insight in its quest to jolt the viewer. This marriage of adrenaline and intelligence will make Fight Club a contender for many Best 10 lists at the end of 1999."" ]";9

No film since last year's The Sweet Hereafter has left such a searing and indelible imprint on my mind and soul. This movie did not need to be released at the end of the year to be considered for a flood of Oscar nominations; it's so forceful that no one who sees it will be able to forget it -- not even Academy members with two-month memory spans."", """", ""Saving Private Ryan opens with a 30-minute cinematic tour de force that is without a doubt one of the finest half-hours ever committed to film. This sequence, a soldier's-eye view of the D-Day invasion of Normandy, is brilliant not only in terms of technique but in the depth of viewer reaction it generates. It is certainly the most violent, gory, visceral depiction of war that I have ever witnessed on screen. Spielberg spares the viewer nothing of the horrors of battle, using every tactic at his disposal to convey the chaos and senseless waste that lies at the core of any engagement. We are presented with unforgettable, bloody images of bodies being cut to pieces by bullets, limbs blown off, entrails spilling out, and a variety of other assorted examples of carnage. And, when the tide comes in with the waves breaking on the body-strewn beach, the water is crimson. Those who are at all squeamish will find the opening of Saving Private Ryan unbearable. This aspect of the film almost earned it an NC-17 rating; only the fact that Spielberg rigorously avoids even a hint of exploitation convinced the MPAA to award an R."", """", ""In addition to showing what happens when projectiles rip into the soft flesh of the human body, the director employs other methods to capture the essence of battle - hand-held cameras, a slight speeding up of the images, muted colors, and several different kinds of film stock. Put it all together, and it adds up to a dizzying, exhausting assault on the senses. As good as the rest of Saving Private Ryan is, and it's very good, the D-Day attack on Omaha Beach is the sequence that everyone will remember most clearly."", """", ""Most World War II movies fall into one of two categories: heroic tales of glory and valor or biopics (my all-time favorite film, Patton, falls in the latter camp). Saving Private Ryan is neither. Instead, it's a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice. In many ways, the picture painted by this movie is more grim than the one Oliver Stone presented in Platoon, which has often been cited as the most daring anti-war film to come out of Hollywood. Saving Private Ryan quickly and brutally dispels the notion that war is anything but vicious, demoralizing violence that makes a cruel joke out of the human body and spirit. Although the film is only loosely based on a true incident, it's hard not to accept these characters and events as real."", """", ""With Saving Private Ryan set alongside Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg, once known as a purveyor of well-crafted-but-lightweight feel-good fare, has given us two of the decade's most gripping, disturbing, and powerful motion pictures. I consider Schindler's List to be one of the most amazing movies I have ever experienced, and, in many ways, Saving Private Ryan is its equal. Although both films take place during the same time period, they focus on different ideas. Schindler's List personifies good (Schindler) and evil (Amon Goeth), and plays out the struggle against a tragic backdrop. In Saving Private Ryan, there are no human villains, and the enemy isn't so much the Germans as it is the implacable, destructive specter of war. The film's central question (When is one life more important than another?) is never really answered. For those who are willing to brave the movie's shocking and unforgettable images, Saving Private Ryan offers a singular motion picture experience.

With patience, care, and strict attention to detail, Scorsese has staked out an impregnable position in the history of motion pictures."", """", ""It is not a coincidence that Scorsese's three masterpieces all star Robert De Niro. These two men, who have worked together eight times, bring out the best in each other. Even their \""lesser\"" collaborations, such as Casino and The King of Comedy, possess an energy and intensity that shows how well they understand one another. Scorsese is at his best when directing De Niro, and De Niro is at his best when being directed by Scorsese. The pair has become inextricably linked in the public consciousness because of Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas."", """", ""There are essentially two kinds of Mafia movies: those that romanticize the life and those that depict it with gut-wrenching clarity. The best known and most accomplished of these films, The Godfather, stakes out its territory firmly in the first area, leaving Goodfellas to stand atop the other. Both pictures have fully realized, three dimensional characters and strong atmospheres, but Francis Ford Coppola's effort embraces the mythos of the gangster, while Scorsese's exploration is more pragmatic. Violence is a key component of each, but it is a more brutal companion in Goodfellas than in The Godfather. Clearly, the different approaches adopted by the directors result in films that, while populating the same genre, are dissimilar in temperament and tone."", """", ""Goodfellas is, as we learn at the very beginning, based (however loosely) on a true story. Developing the screenplay's skeleton from the events related in the novel Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi (who also co-wrote the script), Scorsese has used the facts from an infamous '80s case involving an important mob informant to develop a rich and multi-layered study of three characters and the culture that shaped their lives. It's a fascinating exploration of a lifestyle that has beguiled Americans for most of this century, whether in movies, in novels, or on television."", """", ""Goodfellas is as compelling and absorbing as any crime drama I have ever seen. The script shows all the facets of these characters; they are all fully developed individuals capable of great good and great evil. The moral ambiguity of their lifestyle is treated with a shrug. Goodfellas is not about Mafia dons, but about those who exist on a lower level. It's about the bonds that are formed between compatriots in crime, and how betrayal is the most heinous offense imaginable. The mob is a fraternity - an all-boys club where everyone looks after each other."", """", ""The story, which spans a quarter of a century, has an epic feel despite its intimate perspective. The first forty minutes, which detail Henry's childhood and his acceptance into mob life, is presented almost as a fairy tale, using the same kind of romanticized approach embraced by The Godfather. The purpose of this segment is to forge a bond between the audience and the main character while he is still relatively innocent. Henry does not grow up to be a nice man, but, because of the way Scorsese has structured the early portions of the film, we remain sympathetic to him throughout."", """", ""Over the years, few directors have exhibited Scorsese's ability when it comes to using pop music to set a scene or cement the atmosphere. On many occasions, the appropriation of period songs seems like a transparent attempt to sell the movie's soundtrack album. But, in Goodfellas, Scorsese's selection of \""Then He Kissed Me\"", \""Ain't That a Kick in the Head\"", \""Gimme Shelter\"", \""Monkey Man\"", \""The Magic Bus\"", \""What Is Life\"", and dozens of others proves to be invaluable. The songs mesh perfectly with the visuals, successfully taking the place of a strong score."", """", ""Film critics will argue over which represents Scorsese at his best - Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, or Goodfellas. Each movie has its fierce advocates, but to single out one at the expense of the other two seems to be a pointless and counterproductive enterprise. Taxi Driver and Raging Bull are more focused on an individual than Goodfellas, which examines how a culture shapes values, life choices, and relationships."" ]";9

Pulp Fiction shows what can happen when a talented and accomplished filmmaker reaches his apex."", """", ""This film is one wild ride. An anthology of three interconnected stories that take place in a modern-day Los Angeles tinted by echoes of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, the movie impresses in every possible way. Writer/director Tarantino has merged film noir with the gangster tale and pulled them both into the '90s. As definitive as Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather saga was for the '70s, so is Pulp Fiction for today's generation."", """", ""Pulp Fiction's three tales are structured to intersect and overlap at key points, even though they are not presented in chronological order. Tarantino arranges his initial scene to dovetail with his final one in a remarkable example of closure. Those confused by the structure will see everything clearly once the final line is spoken."", """", ""As was the case in Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's crisp dialogue sparkles. The vulgarity-laced monologues and conversations ripple with humor and are ripe with points to ponder. Foot massages, hamburgers, comfortable silence, a gold watch, pot bellies, divine intervention, and filthy animals - all these and more receive the writer's attention as he presents meaningless issues in an intensely-fascinating and almost lyrical fashion. Who else (except perhaps David Mamet) can make profanity sound so poetic?"", """", ""For anyone who thought they knew the breadth of Bruce Willis' and John Travolta's acting ability, a surprise awaits. Whether it's an effect of the script, the direction, or something else, these two turn in surprisingly strong performances. And they're not the only ones. Uma Thurman, Rosanna Arquette, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Eric Stoltz (who has a Tarantino-related triple play with Pulp Fiction, Killing Zoe, and Sleep With Me), and the director himself are all excellent. And then there's Samuel L. Jackson, who seems to get better with every outing."", """", ""All the details are executed to perfection. Ironies abound in the smallest situations. One death is caused by, of all things, a poptart. And it takes a director of rare talent to find the comedy in so many macabre situations. This goes beyond gallows humor. Mixing the original with the derivative, Tarantino pushes Pulp Fiction in directions that are equally anticipated and unexpected."", """", ""Relentless in its pace, Pulp Fiction is as exhausting as it is exhilarating. In between all the shootings, Mexican standoffs, and other violent confrontations exist opportunities to explore various facets of the human experience, including rebirth and redemption. With this film, every layer that you peel away leads to something deeper and richer. Tarantino makes pictures for movie-lovers, and Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece."" ]";9

Employing unusual camera angles and a unique sense of style, director Nicolas Winding Refn takes us on a journey that gets us to feel something for the characters while still receiving an adrenaline rush when the speedometer races into the red zone. The car chases in this movie are exciting, but the best thing about Drive is that you don't know what's going to happen. There's a sense that the lead character could end up six feet under, and that adds an element of urgency to this movie that most in the genre are missing."", """", ""Ryan Gosling is perhaps an unlikely candidate for an action movie star, not only because he's a good actor (not necessarily a desirable quality for this sort of role) but because his skills are best utilized in dramas and low-key comedies. As it turns out, however, he's a good fit for Drive, in which his inscrutable character, credited only as \""Driver,\"" reveals little background and almost never engages in small talk. Is he autistic or merely an introvert? The movie doesn't much care. Often, dialogue is used to build a character, but Driver speaks so infrequently that it falls upon Gosling's mannerisms and facial expressions to develop someone better realized than a cartoonish stick figure. His success elevates Drive. We become invested not only in the man's life but in the chaste, innocent relationship that develops between Driver and his neighbor, Irene, who is played with a Cathy Rigby/girl-next-door sweetness by Carey Mulligan."", """", ""The movie opens with an explosive, pulse pounding prologue set to a throbbing score by composer Cliff Martinez. Driver does all sorts of jobs - works at a garage, races, drives movie stunt cars, and provides \""transportation\"" for criminals. Drive opens with a getaway, and shows the meticulous planning that goes into one such operation. It includes a stopwatch, a police band radio, and some badass driving. The eight minute sequence could stand on its own as a short. It's the best part of a movie that is otherwise still very good."", """", ""Perhaps because we're so used to seeing Brooks as a sadsack funny guy, we're more sympathetic to his character than we might be if Bernie was played by a more typical wise guy figure. It's effective casting because Brooks is believable. Ron Perlman enjoys chewing a little on his lines; Nino is from the Joe Pesci school of thugs - he shouts a lot and thinks violence isn't just the best way to solve problems; it's the only way. One senses that Bernie has spent half his life cleaning up Nino's messes, as a darkly comedic moment hints."", """", ""Taciturn action heroes are nothing new. Arnold Schwarzenegger strode through many films without cracking a smile. The difference here is that Gosling is not muscle-bound and his silences say more than many character's dialogues. You can see his mind working as he chews on a toothpick and the half-smirk speaks volumes. He doesn't carry a gun but is capable of a shocking degree of violence. In fact, the movie includes scenes worthy of Tarantino in terms of what they show and imply."", """", ""Refn, who strode to international recognition with Bronson, which featured a stunning performance by Tom Hardy, brings a European sense of style to Drive. From the beginning, it's clear this is not a standard-order action film. It takes its characters as seriously as its chases, shootouts, and fights. Neither aspect is short-changed, and the music and cinematography are used to establish and sustain tone. This is a moody film, with moments of understated, dark humor and bleakness. Most importantly, it shows that movies can generate a testosterone-and-adrenaline cocktail without requiring viewers to undergo a frontal lobotomy to appreciate the result."" ]";9

Receiving twelve Academy Award nominations, and again winning Best Picture (and this time Best Director for Coppola as well), the second installment has been rightfully hailed as the best sequel of all time."", """", ""The Godfather Part II is a more ambitious production than the original since it attempts not only to tell a pair of completely disconnected stories, but to do so in parallel. The less time consuming of the two presents the early life of Vito Corleone (played by Robert DeNiro) in Sicily and New York, and shows how he came into power. The other tale picks up approximately a decade after the conclusion of The Godfather, and shows the means by which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now secure in his position, attempts to expand the family empire into Las Vegas and Cuba."", """", ""Plot and counterplot develop, and Michael becomes the focal point of a web of betrayal and deceit, turned against by those he had sought to protect. Assassination attempts and government probes target Michael, but he fights back using every scintilla of ingenuity he possesses and sacrificing much of his humanity in the process."", """", ""The traditional elements of the Tragedy introduced in The Godfather reach their maturity in Part II. Much of the humanity remaining to Michael at the outset is leeched from him with each deception and setback. Late scenes with a resentful Fredo (John Cazale) and a bitter Kay (Diane Keaton) emphasize the price for Michael of continuing his father's dominion. His flaw is his imperceptiveness and, as is the case for any hero in a story of this nature, its effects are crippling."", """", ""Primarily due to the scope of events, Part II is not as tightly-scripted as Part I. While most of the first film takes place in New York (with a few excursions elsewhere), here the settings vary: Sicily, Ellis Island, New York, Nevada, Cuba, Miami, Washington DC. In letting their characters escape the confines of the \""old neighborhood\"", Coppola and Puzo lessen the intimacy of certain interpersonal conflicts."", """", ""Visually, many of Michael's scenes have a more gloomy appearance this time around. Especially during the latter portions of the film, the don is shown in severely underexposed settings, appearing as a silhouette. His is a voice from the darkness - a photographic mirror of what's happening beneath the surface."", """", ""As the beginning of Part II echoes the opening of The Godfather, so too does the end. Because of the manner in which circumstances are handled and considering the people involved, the impact here is more forceful. The tragic flaw has accomplished its poisonous, inevitable designs. Coppola punctuates both movies with a gut-twisting exclamation point."", """", ""Combined, The Godfather and The Godfather Part II represent the apex of American movie-making and the ultimate gangster story. Few sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and detail of this one. Beneath the surface veneer of an ethnic period piece, The Godfather is not so much about crime lords as it is about prices paid in the currency of the soul for decisions made and avoided. It is that quality which establishes this saga as timeless."" ]";9

As a result, in deciding to film Schindler's List, director Steven Spielberg (Jurassic Park) set an imposing task for himself. His vision needed to differ from that of the film makers who preceded him, yet the finished product had to remain faithful to the unforgettable images which represent the legacy of six million massacred Jews. Those who see this motion picture will witness Spielberg's success."", """", ""The film opens in September of 1939 in Krakow, Poland, with the Jewish community under increasing pressure from the Nazis. Into this tumult comes Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Nazi businessman interested in obtaining Jewish backing for a factory he wishes to build. He makes contact with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), an accountant, to arrange financial matters. For a while, there is no interest and nothing happens."", """", ""Spielberg elected to film this motion picture in black-and-white, and it's impossible to argue with his choice. Director of Photography Janusz Kaminski has made effective use of shadow and light, meticulously limiting the application of hue. The opening scene is in color, as is the closing sequence (which features the surviving \""Schindler Jews\"", each accompanied by the actor who played their character, placing a stone on their savior's grave). There are also two instances when color is allowed to bleed into the blacks, whites, and grays. One little girl's jacket appears red so that she stands out from the masses, and a pair of candles burn with orange flames. When color is used, it makes a point and an impression."", """", ""Of course the Holocaust images are grim, but scenes of mass graves and exhumed bodies are not unique to Schindler's List. While it's impossible to deny their power, potentially more distubing are the instances of callous, individual murder. Spielberg doesn't spare his audience when it comes to sudden violence or the dehumanizing factors involved in such events. After all, Jews were viewed as \""vermin.\"" Schindler's List is replete with moments like this."", """", ""The acting is uniformly excellent. Liam Neeson's Schindler is shown in all his complexity, and his transformation is played with studied control. This is no sudden reversal of philosophy, but a matter of conscience that slowly dawns on the man. With a keen sense of Schindler's character, Neeson depicts the metamorphosis from self-centered businessman to driven messiah."", """", ""Despite the grisly subject matter, this movie is essentially about uncovering a kernel of hope and dignity in the midst of a monstrous tragedy. The story of Oskar Schindler's sacrifices for the Jews sets this apart from other Holocaust dramas. Uncompromising in its portrayal of good, evil, and all the shades in between, Schindler's List offers a clear view of human nature laid bare: hatred, greed, lust, envy, anger, and, most important of all, empathy and love. Because this film touches us so deeply, the catharsis has a power that few -- if any -- other moments in film history can match. And that's what establishes this as a transcendent motion picture experience."" ]";9

According to the movie release schedule, it's December 17. There can be no greater gift for a movie lover than the one bestowed upon audiences by Peter Jackson, whose The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not only the best movie of 2003, but the crowning cinematic achievement of the past several years. In fact, labeling this as a \""movie\"" is almost an injustice. This is an experience of epic scope and grandeur, amazing emotional power, and relentless momentum."", """", ""One could be forgiven for initially approaching The Return of the King with a little trepidation. As good as the first two films, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, are (in either their theatrical or extended DVD versions), movie history is littered with occasions when trilogy conclusions have crashed and burned. Return of the Jedi. Godfather III. The Matrix Revolutions. And so on? Yet, with The Return of the King, Jackson has done more than just bucked the trend. Not only is this motion picture an entirely worthy conclusion to the landmark trilogy, but it's better than its predecessors. Somehow, Jackson has managed to synthesize what worked in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, while siphoning off the less successful elements. The result is amazing. Taken as a whole, there is nothing out there today that can come close to comparing to The Lord of the Rings."", """", ""The slowest portions of The Return of the King occur early in the proceedings, as Jackson re-establishes the characters. From there, it's a slow, steady buildup to a rousing climax. The experience is so immersive that I found myself in the middle of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields along with the heroes, rooting for them - even though I knew how things were going to turn out! Along the way, there are moments of genuine pathos that draw a tear from the eye; times of triumph that cause the heart to soar; instances of overwhelming tension that cause the adrenaline to surge; and images of spectacle that make the jaw drop. The pace is unflagging - once Jackson has us, he doesn't let go. When the movie was over, I couldn't believe that 3 1/4 hours had passed."", """", ""Although it's unfair to characterize the film as a collection of great moments - the character arcs and overall narrative are too strong for that - it is nevertheless impossible to deny the power of many individual scenes. One of Jackson's most notable contributions is that he directs the film with the intention that certain instances will raise nape hairs. It's the \""wow\"" factor, and it is frequently repeated. Gene Siskel once argued that a great film needs three memorable scenes to go along with no bad ones. The Return of the King exceeds that criteria by a considerable amount."", """", ""For those who despise truncated endings, Jackson has a treat in store. The Return of the King ends with a 20 minute epilogue that chronicles events after the War of the Ring, going as much as four years into the future and tying up nearly every possible loose end. The film concludes on exactly the same note as the book (in fact, with the same line), and, while the final chapter of the trilogy is as satisfying as it could possibly be, there's still a vague sense of melancholy when \""The End\"" appears on the screen, because it means that these adventures are over."", """", ""The acting shines through more in The Return of the King than in the other films. Elijah Wood is excellent as Frodo, a shell of the cheerful hobbit he once was. Sean Astin transforms Sam into a fierce knight protector, defending his master against the treacherous Gollum, the terrifying Shelob, and the forces of Mordor. Viggo Mortensen gives Aragorn his fullest opportunity to be seen as a three-dimensional hero. Newcomer John Noble, as Denethor, the Protector of Gondor, displays madness laced with cunning. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies have less to do, but provide us with a little comedic banter as well as some more serious moments. Miranda Otto's Eowen is as sharp and fierce as any man, and far better looking. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are given a chance to flesh out Pippin and Merry. Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, and Ian Holm all make brief appearances."", """", ""Expectedly, the special effects set a new standard. The CGI participants of the major battles look more like real combatants than cartoonish computer creations. The locations, set design, and costumes are without flaw. By building many of the elaborate locales, Jackson achieves a sense of verisimilitude that he might not have attained by relying more heavily on computers. And composer Howard Shore's score is perfectly wed to the visuals, being alternately bombastic and delicate, as circumstances dictate."", """", ""The Lord of the Rings will go down in cinematic lore as a milestone."" ]";9

However, during more than four-dozen TV shows and movies, he has yet to challenge himself with the most difficult role for a well-liked actor - that of a bad-to-the-bone villain. He comes close in Road to Perdition, but doesn't quite reach that destination. For, although Michael Sullivan is a murderer for hire, he also has a conscience and a soul, loves his family, and kills not because he likes it but because it's his job. In short, Sullivan is portrayed sympathetically. The script's positive spin and Hanks' instant likeability ensure that Sullivan will be viewed not as a bad guy, but as a flawed man. There's some darkness there, to be sure, but not the pitch black of pure evil."", """", ""The film, director Sam Mendes' eagerly anticipated follow-up to American Beauty, is based on the \""graphic novel\"" (a term that is applied to a very long comic book printed on high-quality paper and sold in bookstores) by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. As with many adaptations from this medium, Road to Perdition stuns with its atmosphere and visuals, but arguably underachieves in some aspects of its characterization and plotting."", """", ""Road to Perdition allows you to feel, smell, and breathe the air of 1930s Chicago. To some extent, Conrad L. Hall is as big a star as any of the actors, since there are occasions when the setting overwhelms the characters. At its heart, Road to Perdition is a little drama about fathers, sons, and the covenants they make and break. Rooney betrays Sullivan to save Connor, even though, to the very end, he loves Sullivan best. Sullivan risks everything, including his life and reputation, to protect Michael. A telling conversation between Rooney and Sullivan italicizes this point. \""And there is only one guarantee--none of us will see Heaven,\"" says Rooney. \""Michael might,\"" replies Sullivan. Rooney then notes that it's Sullivan's primary duty to make sure that happens."", """", ""Road to Perdition romanticizes gangland Chicago, but no more so than other films set in the same period. And, like almost every movie about the mob, this one deals with themes of family, loyalty, and betrayal - albeit without the intensity of some of the great ones (The Godfather, Goodfellas). As was the case in American Beauty, Mendes illustrates how accomplished actors will respond to an assured director.

The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion."", """", ""Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual.

In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (\""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man\"") and despises displays of weakness.

They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries."", """", ""Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word \""Mafia\"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience."", """", ""We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told.

179;fight-club;10;MovieManiac83;/user/MovieManiac83;"[ ""With its kinetic style, visceral approach, compelling storyline, and powerful social message, Fight Club makes a commanding case to be considered the '90s version of A Clockwork Orange. In a time when so few motion pictures leave an impact, Fight Club refuses to be ignored or dismissed. The experience lingers, demanding to be pondered and considered, and, unlike 95% of modern-day thrillers, there is a great deal here to think about and argue over. Fight Club presents an overload of thought-provoking material that works on so many levels as to offer grist for the mills of thousands of reviews, feature articles, and post-screening conversations."", """", ""Pre-release interest in Fight Club was understandably high, primarily because of those involved with the project. Jim Uhls' script is based on an influential novel by Chuck Palahniuk (a book that, while not required material in schools, has consumed the free time of countless readers). The lead actor is the ever-popular Brad Pitt, who makes his strongest bid to date to shed his pretty boy image and don the mantle of a serious thespian. Those dubious about Pitt's ability to pull this off in the wake of his recent attempts in Seven Years in Tibet (which is briefly referenced as an in-joke during Fight Club) and Meet Joe Black will suffer a change of heart after seeing this film. Pitt's male co-star, Edward Norton, is widely recognized as one of the most intelligent and versatile performers of his generation. And Fight Club's director, David Fincher, has already made a huge artistic impression on movie-goers with only three features to his credit: Alien 3, Seven (starring Pitt), and The Game. Mix these elements together in Fox's publicity blender, and Fight Club will not carry the title of \""Best Movie of 1999 That No One Saw.\"""", """", ""Told in a conventional fashion, Fight Club would still have been engaging. However, Fincher's gritty, restless style turns it into a visual masterpiece. The overall experience is every bit as surreal as watching Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. This is a tale that unfolds in an eerie alternate universe where the melodies of life have the same rhythm as in ours but are in a different key. Fincher also shows just enough restraint that his flourishes seem like important parts of the storytelling method instead of gimmicks. And there are a lot of them. In one scene, a character's apartment is laid out like a page in a furniture catalog, complete with text blurbs superimposed on the screen describing the various pieces. There are occasional single frame interruptions that flash by so quickly that they may pass unnoticed. The film opens with a truly inventive close-up - one that literally gets under the skin. Also in play: a non-linear chronology, a voiceover by a narrator who might not be entirely reliable, frequent breaking of the fourth wall, and an occasional freeze-frame. As was true of Fincher's other three films, Fight Club is dark and fast-paced. There's not a lot of time for introspection. One could call this MTV style, but, unlike many equally frantic movies, there's a reason for each quick cut beyond preventing viewers from becoming bored."", """", ""Perhaps the most discussed aspect of Fight Club will be its attitude towards and graphic depiction of violence. Even before the film's official premiere, voices have been raised claiming that the movie glorifies violence by portraying it as something positive. This was the complaint leveled against A Clockwork Orange, which, less than three decades after its controversial release, is universally regarded as a classic. There's no denying that Fight Club is a violent movie. Some sequences are so brutal that a portion of the viewing audience will turn away. (The scene that caused me to wince was when one character reached into his mouth and pulled out a loose tooth.) But the purpose of showing all this bloody pummeling is to make a telling point about the bestial nature of man and what can happen when the numbing effects of day-to-day drudgery cause people to go a little crazy. The men who become members of Fight Club are victims of the dehumanizing and desensitizing power of modern-day society. They have become cogs in a wheel. The only way they can regain a sense of individuality is by getting in touch with the primal, barbaric instincts of pain and violence."", """", ""It remains to be seen whether Fight Club will generate any Oscars. The strength of the writing, direction, and acting justifies a stream of nominations, but quality has never been the driving factor in who is recognized by the Academy. Regardless of how it is received in February, when the nominations are announced, Fight Club is a memorable and superior motion picture - a rare movie that does not abandon insight in its quest to jolt the viewer. This marriage of adrenaline and intelligence will make Fight Club a contender for many Best 10 lists at the end of 1999."" ]";9

As was true of director Steven Spielberg's other masterpiece, Schindler's List, the impact of this motion picture must be experienced; it cannot be adequately described. No film since last year's The Sweet Hereafter has left such a searing and indelible imprint on my mind and soul. This movie did not need to be released at the end of the year to be considered for a flood of Oscar nominations; it's so forceful that no one who sees it will be able to forget it -- not even Academy members with two-month memory spans."", """", ""Saving Private Ryan opens with a 30-minute cinematic tour de force that is without a doubt one of the finest half-hours ever committed to film. This sequence, a soldier's-eye view of the D-Day invasion of Normandy, is brilliant not only in terms of technique but in the depth of viewer reaction it generates. It is certainly the most violent, gory, visceral depiction of war that I have ever witnessed on screen. Spielberg spares the viewer nothing of the horrors of battle, using every tactic at his disposal to convey the chaos and senseless waste that lies at the core of any engagement. We are presented with unforgettable, bloody images of bodies being cut to pieces by bullets, limbs blown off, entrails spilling out, and a variety of other assorted examples of carnage. And, when the tide comes in with the waves breaking on the body-strewn beach, the water is crimson. Those who are at all squeamish will find the opening of Saving Private Ryan unbearable. This aspect of the film almost earned it an NC-17 rating; only the fact that Spielberg rigorously avoids even a hint of exploitation convinced the MPAA to award an R."", """", ""In addition to showing what happens when projectiles rip into the soft flesh of the human body, the director employs other methods to capture the essence of battle - hand-held cameras, a slight speeding up of the images, muted colors, and several different kinds of film stock. Put it all together, and it adds up to a dizzying, exhausting assault on the senses. As good as the rest of Saving Private Ryan is, and it's very good, the D-Day attack on Omaha Beach is the sequence that everyone will remember most clearly."", """", ""Most World War II movies fall into one of two categories: heroic tales of glory and valor or biopics (my all-time favorite film, Patton, falls in the latter camp). Saving Private Ryan is neither. Instead, it's a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice. In many ways, the picture painted by this movie is more grim than the one Oliver Stone presented in Platoon, which has often been cited as the most daring anti-war film to come out of Hollywood. Saving Private Ryan quickly and brutally dispels the notion that war is anything but vicious, demoralizing violence that makes a cruel joke out of the human body and spirit. Although the film is only loosely based on a true incident, it's hard not to accept these characters and events as real."", """", ""There's nothing especially complex about the structure of Saving Private Ryan. The film, which runs nearly three hours, is bookended by two major battle scenes. In between, smaller fights alternate with quiet, character-building moments that flesh out the soldiers, allowing them to escape the threat of stereotyping. Spielberg, along with writer Robert Rodat and the actors, ensures that everyone in the movie is developed into a multi-dimensional individual for whom we can grieve if and when they die. They are \""citizen soldiers\"" -- ordinary men caught in the teeth of extraordinary circumstances. With the exception of a little manipulation at the end (when tears are actually a welcome source of relief from the film's intensity), Saving Private Ryan rigorously avoids toying with our emotions."", """", ""With Saving Private Ryan set alongside Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg, once known as a purveyor of well-crafted-but-lightweight feel-good fare, has given us two of the decade's most gripping, disturbing, and powerful motion pictures. I consider Schindler's List to be one of the most amazing movies I have ever experienced, and, in many ways, Saving Private Ryan is its equal. Although both films take place during the same time period, they focus on different ideas. Schindler's List personifies good (Schindler) and evil (Amon Goeth), and plays out the struggle against a tragic backdrop. In Saving Private Ryan, there are no human villains, and the enemy isn't so much the Germans as it is the implacable, destructive specter of war. The film's central question (When is one life more important than another?) is never really answered. For those who are willing to brave the movie's shocking and unforgettable images, Saving Private Ryan offers a singular motion picture experience. I will be surprised if another film tops it for the best of 1998."" ]";9

185;interstellar;10;MovieManiac83;/user/MovieManiac83;"[ ""Christopher Nolan has never shied away from a challenge and the one he has taken on with Interstellar may be his most prodigious thus far - bigger than delivering an end-to-start chronology in Memento, more impressive than the mind-bending contortions of Inception, and more daunting than re-imagining Batman into the most unique superhero franchise of the 21st century. Interstellar is simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking. It's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Nolan has crafted Interstellar as a movie theater experience. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match. This is one time when the IMAX surcharge is worth it."", """", ""Interstellar is science fiction. It's not space opera. It's not futuristic fantasy. It's what the term \""science fiction\"" was coined to represent. It presents a viable future in which space travel, while possible, is dangerous and uncertain. Starships aren't zipping from planet to planet. Space craft aren't firing lasers, phasers, or photon torpedoes. Travel across long distances uses the dangerous and unpredictable method of entering a wormhole, not engaging Warp One or making the jump to hyperspace. Time dilation comes into effect in the presence of a black hole and there's even a little bit about the relationship between quantum mechanics and relativity. This isn't Star Wars, Star Trek, or Guardians of the Galaxy, and anyone who approaches it with such expectations will be disappointed. It's more along the lines of recent movies like Contact (which also starred Matthew McConaughey) and Gravity in that it acknowledges science rather than ignoring the rules of reality as we understand them."", """", ""It will be difficult to find a review of Interstellar that doesn't reference 2001: A Space Odyssey and there's a valid reason for that. Nolan at times uses Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece as a template, especially during moments of grandeur. Hans Zimmer's score is no less crucial to Interstellar than \""Also Sprach Zarathustra\"" was to 2001. Yet, this is no mere copy of Kubrick's film; in fact, it goes far afield. There's heroism, a la The Right Stuff. It's also a warmer, more emotional experience - less stately and abstruse. In fact, found at the core of this big budget adventure is the most relatable thing imaginable: the feelings of love and trust that bind father and daughter. It's almost a fusion of Kubrick and Spielberg."", """", ""The film is nearly three hours but there's enough story here for something a lot longer. In condensing it, Nolan has made something 169 minutes in length that breezes by faster than many productions half its length. He accomplishes this by establishing a blistering pace during Interstellar's meatier sections, including expert cross-cutting between Earth and space during a powerful \""fire and ice\"" sequence."", """", ""Visually, Interstellar looks great. Nolan understands all the facets of special effects technology (except, perhaps, old age makeup) and uses them to their best. Hans Zimmer delivers an operatic score that, although occasionally drowning out dialogue (more a mixing issue than a scoring one), adds to the overall experience. Sound is important to Interstellar - when the rocket lifts off around the 45-minute mark, the bass shakes the entire theater."", """", ""It has been a tremendous year for McConaughey. From Dallas Buyers Club to True Detective to Interstellar, he has won a Golden Globe and an Oscar and been nominated for an Emmy. Interstellar will give him another opportunity for Academy recognition: he's the glue that holds everything together. He's the human factor in a vast universe. His love for his daughter and his pain when he acknowledges her despair invests this movie with a warmth and feeling that no previous Nolan movie can boast. The supporting cast, which includes Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, is strong, but McConaughey represents the heart and soul of Interstellar."", """", ""For anyone with a hunger for real science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers (and that I often enjoy immensely), Interstellar is a satisfying entrée. I'd rank this alongside Memento and The Dark Knight as the best Nolan has done, and it's an immediate contender for one of 2014's best. The film deserves the label of an \""experience\"" and the bigger the venue, the more immersive it will be. As event movies go, this is one of the most unique and mesmerizing."" ]";9

As we all know about in romantic comedies is that woman are very successful and they are hungry to get married and finding the right one. As well as trying to desperately doing some antics to achieve that goal. Leap Year follows that routine and you might be wondering why I haven't thrown it away yet. It's that damn Amy Adams she makes everything watch able. She can make a turd look good. Go ahead and photograph her with a turd next to it. I swear you'll say \""Oh that turd isn't that bad.\"" The film opens up that Anna (Adams) is in a relationship with Jeremy (Adam Scott) who hasn't asked her to get married yet. Anna feeling disappointed abandons all hopes, but her father tells her about an old Irish tradition that once every leap year the woman proposes to the man. Of courses pack up the suitcases and get yourself into funny situations and you got yourself a movie. Then he meet the rough all around the edges-but charming-a#$hole Irish guy. I think I don't have to explain the plot anymore you kind of got the idea of where it's going.  The movie succeeds because of Adams and there's not much chemistry between Matthew Goode and her. It's a rehash of every other romantic comedy out there but it was funny, it wasn't offensive either. An other thing I liked was that the guy was just a plain looking guy not dreamboats, which they usually cast. Finally the girl chases after the guy at least it's something different.

The best war movies I have seen that are worth to watch again and again are Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan and Platoon.. They were able to capture the essence and pathos of soldiers. There are many more that I would like to see. However there are not much Iraq war movies out there, until Kathryn Bigelow directed and release The Hurt Locker which won Best Picture and Best Director. Then came along another film that people ignore and it's worth a watch. The Messenger talks about grief, loneliness, pain and the transition to coexist in the real world. Our men in uniform call home the real world while the combat zone is hell. I personally experience my cousin who's like a brother to me went to Iraq and came back injured and the terrible time our family went through. He's all right now and finish with the Army. I love movies that deeply respect soldiers and doesn't succumb them into melodramatic plots and clich?ar stories or bloody violence. I'm talking to you Pearl Harbor and Windtalkers. Ben Foster who I compare to Anthony Mackie from The Hurt Locker who should have been nominated plays Staff Sgt. Will Montgomery. He just came back from Iraq after serious injuries. He's already despising the fact of everybody calling him a hero. He already has bad luck when his girlfriend leaves him for another guy. He has three months left on his enlistment and his commanding officer orders him to join the Army's Casualty Notification service. He's reluctant but is forced to join. Here he meets Capt. Tony Stone who is he's partner and training officer. The movie is power full when they go and notify the families of the fallen soldiers. There are gut wrenching scenes which are not to be taken lightly especially if you are family who has lost loved one in Iraq. There is a scene with the great actor Steve Buscemi that completely steals the scene and one of my favorite scenes of the movie.  Then they notify Kelly played very well by Jena Malone who is now a single mother because of her husband dying. Strangely Will is attracted and intrigue by her. He helps her with things around the house and visits her and eats dinner with her and her son. This is something that he can't do and angers Tony, Will who feels everybody in the world doesn't understand him Kelly is a safe haven for him. She's needy and he's needy in his own way. The movie works as well because of the chemistry Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster has. They start off not liking each other but gradually getting along. Tony feels the up most respect towards Will because of his combat experience and at the same time jealousy because of his lack of combat. Will teaches Tony that the families are human then just names on a piece of paper. I feel the flaw of the film is that it loses its focus when the romance starts with Will and Kelly. There are good scenes between them, don't get me wrong but I feel the movie loses track and doesn't head into the right direction but it does pick it self up and finish very satisfying. The movie is thought full and very respectful towards its subject. The movie has no war violence whatsoever but Will's brutal description of the events will make you shudder. A very good movie and must be seen."", """", ""Note: It's funny on my senior year I was going to join the Army and I was to be sent to Fort Knox, Kentucky and my MOS was going to be Calvary Scout.

Damn it I'm twenty three years old and I freaking cried with Toy Story 3 it's one of the best movies of the year. Those folks at Pixar are really outdone themselves, move the hell out of the way How to Train a Dragon let Toy Story pick up its Oscar before schedule. The movie begins with the imagination of a young boy and we kind of see what the toys see when there playing with their kids. Then a homemade video of Andy when he was younger playing with the toys. The gang is scared because Andy hasn't played with them for a long time and to make matters worse he's going off to college. The toys are afraid to be thrown away. After a confusion the toys accidentally do get thrown away and feeling rejected they decide to donate themselves to a daycare ignoring Woody's protest. When they get there they get accepted with the toys and Lots-O the leader of the daycare makes them feel at home even though we feel something wrong.  This movie proves that animation is growing and growing big. We need animation in every aspect of the genres. United States has categorized animation with children but can be use in every film. The Toy Story crews are true pioneers for this craft. The film looks outstanding much more improved then the first two. We get lot character models and facial expressions from toys and lot more human interactions as well. Everything is nicely animated from Andy's house to the daycare and other locations. There are times which I want just pick up these toys and freaking hug them. Everybody is nicely cast and including some new ones as well. The voice casting is downright excellent just like the first two. The plot is so well written with so many themes to teach. It teaches us about our loss of our childhood and we lose are imagination as we get older. The acceptance of being adult, it teaches about overcoming greed and being a family no matter what the circumstances are. Lastly with all the movies that are ending with obligatory action sequences and slapstick. Toy Story has one of the most beautiful endings ever. This movie reminded me so much of my childhood and sometimes I miss it. The film has the best ending of a trilogy since I saw the Lord of The Rings ending. I miss when cinema was like this a strong plot, strong performances. The film industry needs this kind of cinema. Go watch Toy Story 3 and be amazed."" ]";6

He receives good news about future plans with his business. He has the perfect life until one night an intruder enters his home to rob. His first mistake was to chase after him outside of the house. He accidentally hits him in the back of the head with a baseball bat thinking he had a gun which he didn't. He gets charged with murder but the district attorney has compassion and lets him serve three years in jail but will be release on good behavior in fifteen months if he keeps that way. He goes to jail and that's when he enters a world that he really can't understand. He goes through a lot of crazy stuff especially a brutal and psychotic correctional officer. He then meets John Smith played by Val Kilmer who is a veteran in prison and at first a little bit distant to him. Throughout Wade's time there they form a somewhat friendship; and Smith starts teaching him ways to tolerate prison life. The key thing that makes this movie work is the performances which are very top notch. Val Kilmer we miss you on the big screen when are you coming back. Thunderheart, Top Gun, Tombstone, The Doors those were awesome movies where you great and hopefully Macgruber doesn't suck. Kilmer plays John Smith to the core and he's very imposing, Kilmer did his research. Dorff played a very sympathetic performance and convinced me all the way. I seriously thought he was a lost cause ever since from being the villain Decon Frost in Blade which he was pretty good. These two actors own the movie and they have great chemistry.  The movie loses a potential fifth star because the prison scenes are very brutal and unforgiving and it's not an easy movie to watch. I understand prison life is not easy and I can't say I have experience it, I can only imagined it and hopefully never experience it. However, the movie would make audience feel a shock is coming on every reel when we're suppose to care more about the characters and plot not the next blow to the head. Although Felon surprise me a lot and it's worth to watch for the performances of Kilmer and Dorff."" ]";6
497;funny-people;10;thelordoffilm;/user/thelordoffilm;"[ ""Funny People is a intelligent, funny adult film. Now a days the genre of comedy is now sex. We get a number of new movies every year trying to milk the success of Judd Apatow films. Some of them are good and I can name a few. However they need to rely on crude and vulgar actions to get laughs. We get so many of those antics to the point of feeling disgust for the characters, but when the third act comes up we have to cheer for them it's dumb. Apatow's movies are different there fresh in orignatly and the crude and vulgar comedy is kept to a restrictive level. Thus giving us time to know the characters in between the big laughs. The movie starts with George Simmons played by Adam Sandler, he's a successful comedian and actor. He has stared in many films and is a prodigy to all standups. He lives alone and does mostly everything alone. One day he's sitting in a doctors office getting the news that he's been diagnosied with a rare form of cancer. His doctor firmily says it, he needs to try out expermental medicine. We then meet Ira played by Seth Rogen who's a up and coming comic trying to get out of the deli that he works at. One day George performs at a standclub that he has'nt been in three years. He notices Ira's performance and takes him under his wing as a assistant. They form a friendship and where George goes Ira goes. He trys to make ammends with his famliy and with the girl that got away, played by Leslie Mann who is married to someone else. So when George is thinking the worst his doctor tells him your getting better and tells him get a hold of your life again. You must think in a clinched kind of way he changes his personality and treat people better and go for the girl right? wrong, he exploits his condtion and tries to go for the girl. These are characters in a realistic plot. With problems and smart dialouge. Yes theirs crude and vulgar actions but it's done in a way that everyday people talk, with your friends, with your spouse. Judd Apatow did a very mature film proving you can mix vulgar and adaptable characters. This movie is based on everyday people with the only difference is that there Funny People."" ]";6

499;crazy-heart;10;thelordoffilm;/user/thelordoffilm;"[ ""Crazy Heart is a real American movie, it's not a remake or reboot. It's original work that needs to be seen. Of all the generic movies of violence and bad storytelling it's very refreshing to see a movie that cares for its characters and plot.  Crazy Heart tells the story of Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) a washed-out country singer who's not a very likeable guy. He curses, drinks, and very lazy. He use to be the top dog in country but we can just tell he screw that up. His agent clearly forces him and yells at him to get up and do a performance and not to f@#k it up. He refuses to collaborate with another country singer named Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) which we get a notion of a disagreement between them from the past. Bridges performance is so good that we can tell the age of experience from his actions and mannerisms. We can tell his sadness from his actions with the way he acts and his judgments. All of these things start to change once he meet Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a writer and her son. At first is sexual but then he starts falling for her and for his son. He decides to reinvent his life and people it's not easy for him.  Bridge's performance is downright awesome and finally the recognition he deserves. He comes from a huge career of movies and he nailed this one. He created a character that was believable. There were times when we wanted to cry for him and when we were angry with him. The supporting cast was very good as well. Gyllenhaal was very good and gave a very good supportive role. Colin Farrell as well who does more action flicks shows that he has more meaning and dramatic depths. Yeah the plot is familiar with music stars but the performances form the actors rise to another level. I think this movie shines a light on movies where we lost the effect that movie does for us. This is a movie who has important things to say, films are suppose to be teach aspects of life and to entertain. Some movies are satires and some movies are protests. You want to know what Crazy Heart teaches, see it yourself and let it teach you.  One of the best films of 2009."" ]";6

'When in Rome' is engaging, sweet, yet a cool movie. It never gets tacky or overly emotional/corney. Seeing this movie was like a refreshing breeze! . If you are trying to find realism in comedies, you are not always going to find it and you may get disappointed with this. The purpose of a comedy is making you laugh, and in order to do so, the resources that producers/directors/writers use are very diverse and those may include 'fairy tale' sort of fantasy! At the end,what is important is that you enjoy it . The plot of this movie is a bit 'Disney-like' so even your children-in you have them- may enjoy it. But remember, this movie is not there to teach you anything, nor is it there to be trascendental, for is just a comedy; thus, is just about having a good time.

This movie is about inner strength about having the ability to get through life with faith, acknowledging one's limitations yet, fighting to acomplish our goals. It is also about loyalty and courage... and about frustration too, because not everything can be changed since there are things that escape to our hands. It may be over emotional and overly 'optimistic', but it does not diminish its value.

Perhaps there are some small details that needed to be clarified -if they were not left like that deliberately-, but, in movies, as it is in life, there is always room for improvement. The performances were great, and the characters were perfectly elaborates, so the audience empathize with them. I actually felt pretty close to Laura and Simon, and also to the 'ghost' children and their story. Moreover, this movie manages to continuously surprise us. There is always suspense, which makes it thrilling. In fact, at time, I had goosebumps; that, even though I am not a person who gets easily scared. Further, I love the emotional component of the film, because it was not a movie that dealt merely with death, life, and the super natural world, but it was a movie that confronted us about how each of us deals with his/her humanity. The Orphanage questions our coping mechanisms to face, pain, loss, reality, the 'unknown', and more. I think that those people who see is a 'dumb' 'silly' 'pointless' or 'boring' movie are probably more into gore or have a very narrow perspective about what is horror. I have read some of the reasons why some put this movie just a '1 or 2', and frankly, in most of the cases, their criticism shows an absolutely basic analytical thought. So, if you like intellectual stimulation, this is the movie for you! It is magnificently done. Moreover, the photography is breathtaking, so is the landscape. I loved the ending I found it very powerful...and open to your imagination. I did have tears, and I am not an overly emotional person so that means something to me. I think I can easily watch this movie twice the same day, not just because of its beauty, but also to play myself a bit with the clues...I may be able to discover more about it.!..An end note: I did like this movie more than Pan's Laberynth. I find The Orphanage is much better. Pan's Labyrinth was beautiful -what I enjoyed the most was the art direction- but the whole story didn't really impressed me much. The Orphanage is Del Toro's masterpiece!"" ]";6

The story is interesting and it takes a while for the mistery to be unfolded. Although some may have already thought where the answer was, the way it was done in the movie, is to be applauded. Good performances and good cast. It had an interesting perspective, that made me reflect-again- in how dangerous religious fanatism can be to the world ( be aware I mean, fanatism, for there is nothing wrong with religion itself) and how easy to manipulate are human beings under certain conditions. Great ending, although sad. Overall, a good movie but i am disappointed to se the low score, especially considering how many good reviews it got...I wonder if the metacritic system is working for I don't see it changing much days after some comments are post..strange indeed.

524;death-sentence;7;RegOz;/user/RegOz;"[ ""What can I say? Perhaps I am biased, but I will be totally sincere. This is NOT a great movie, but I enjoyed it so much, that I myself got surprised! My friends did too, and they are people that nobody on Earthh could call 'dumb' but the opposite. Partly, the reasons for my excitement about this film,  may be because Kevin Bacon is the leading figure and I adore Kevin Bacon, for he is one of the most accomplished, versatile, serious, and down-to-Earth actors of Hollywood-and  he is as underrated as Gary Oldman or Sean Penn (yet even a better actor -and according to the media and general belief he is also a nicer person-than them), so whenever I watch a movie where he is performing, my attitude becomes more open, for just his acting gives a movie a higher value. That said, (and I am acknowledging I may be biased), this movie is not brilliand but good in its genre.  Those who love action filsm we'll see here a bit of the anti-hero. You may find this movie a bit unrealistic, and you are probably right. I don't think, however, that when they made Death Sentence the producers wanted to create a classic, but instead a good action- fiction film! I think they succeeded, for Death Sentence is always intense, and engaging! I know that some of us think that a situation like this is very unlikely to happen. A person doesn't turn into \""Rambo' or a \""killing machine' just because they want justice for their family and the legal system does not provide them with that. Nonetheless, I wonder if something like that would happen to my boy...what would I do, or at least attempt to do? I am a girl- and a feminine one- but in my own way, perhaps pain and sorrow would force me to take a difficult, emotional, and yet ilogical decision! I don't know!. Perhaps the movie  is not that unrealistic, after all. So, my advice is: forget about prejudices and go and be ready to watch a movie that although a bit strange, it never bores! A solid 7 for sure!

Actually, Mr. Brooks is quite clear, and easy to follow, engaging and dynamic; although it may definitely be predictable in some moments and there was room for improvement, it was still a good film. What I like the most are Coster and Hurt's performances...you even get to emphatize with them and like them.  Their interplay is delightful, it was refreshing watching and listening to their characters interactions. Finally, as others, I too think that critics have been too harsh, they have missed the point of Mr. Brooks...while they often sometimes praise movies that are below the average. That is why critics should never be taken too seriously since all of them -for good or for bad- have a background that shapes their perception of a film...they do have bias, just as much as we do too."" ]";6

Some even compare it with JAWS, which makes no sense, because apart from the fact that both have sharks involved in each story, they are totally different movies. Open Water is a thriller  while Jaws is a monster movie -not really horror as many affirm- which attempts to create fear...and to me it fails. I definitely like Open Water much more than Jaws. Jaws was perhaps the first blockbuster. The idea was appealing and  with the aid of a mechanical shark that we only see once, creates a feeling of danger. Nonetheless, the story itself is weak, and silly. The performances are feeble. Nobody cares about the characters for they are fake.  I remember when I was a child I liked Jaws but recently I watched again and almost felt asleep. There were movies great movies that also involved animals (i.e The Birds) so Jaws has no excuse. Open Water, on the other side, is pure realism!  I am an Australian, thus, I always hear stories about sharks. In fact, I know people who continually dive along the Great Barrier Reef. None of them believe the JAWS is a smart movie while they agree that Open Water shows some of the dangers that they as professional divers face in real life. The smallest mistake can change their lives."", ""Moreover, Open Water, goes beyond the issue of sharks. The presence of sharks is indeed an important element of the movie but the core of this film is the situation itself. It is therefore, not a shark movie! This film explores the feelings of those involved in the story and smartly takes us to their world. We see when, how, and why such feelings develop. We feel for them, understand them, and wish we had the ways to help them. Furthermore, the sporadic jokes that the characters make to each other when the the situation becomes clear, and when the tangible threat is perceived, are not stupid; on the opposite, it adds realism. Many of us, under very stressful, desperate, hopeless, and/or frightening, circumstances tend to joke about them; it is a way to cheer us up and distract from those negative feelings; same there.  I also love the scene when Daniel starts screaming, what a touching moment! Great performance. It was a totally believable: a desperate yell! There was frustration, despair, anger, sorrow, anguish, desolation;  all those feelings together in that particular scene. Powerful!"", ""Since the beginning when they are in bed and she is naked, and they are just chatting. It happens to be a very smart scene, for  it actually helps to create a feeling of reality and it succeeds; hat is why I don't get why people have issues with that scene. Aren't we naked on a daily basis?. If some didn't understand certain moments or the ending, they may need to watch the movie again and more carefully. If they still don't find the answer,...well, it doesn't mean it is not there, for to many of us the movie is as clear as crystal. Finally,  If you haven't watched it, please do it, and take into account what I say, so open your mind to the experience...I don't think you will regret it...and if you do, at least you gave it a go."" ]";6

545;the-passion-of-the-christ;9;RegOz;/user/RegOz;"[ ""As some of the critics argue, this is not a movie that is meant to be a sermon, or to teach you something. It is not focused in Jesus's life, and I don't believe it attempts to be a religious film. It focuses in the last 12 hours of Jesus life as they could have been. Of course by those times many other people were brutally tortured and killed on this way but there is no much mentioned about them because they were just common people. Jesus was different, and either if you believe in what he praised or not , he was a historical figure that changed the life of many, and the spiritual face of the Western World.  Back to the film, the acting was certainly good! The Art direction of this movie was amazing, yet the images were extremely violent, and I had difficulty watching them, but in spite of it, I did. An observation: a few comments below, the user called ANDY mentioned that Anthropologists believe that Jesus looked different and blah, blah. Well, ANDY, curiously, I happen to have a PhD in Anthropology and Sociology, and I also have some education in history and in my 20's I used to be a theatre performer,(now I am just my 30's, and not, I am not at all a nerd or a nerd looking, quite the opposite) so my answer to you Andy is: Don't talk what you don't really know! You are just repeating what the mass-media say! Research in journals and serious academic publications if you really aim to increase your knowledge on the matter. There are many different approaches about Jesus's life. It is also  impossible to know how Jesus looked or not or how did he lead his private life! Therefore,  we should stop referring to petty stuff as arguments against this film, for that is senseless criticism. If Jesus had long hair or not, if he was really the Son of God,  or not,  who cares...! This film is not a  proselyist one!  Finally, let's be fair, just because people do not like religion-and most of people here probably not- it doesn't mean the movie is bad or old fashion! I am not religious myself, but I can still see and appreciate this film for what it is. Guys, this may not be your cup of tea, but objetively, it is a magnificent work!"" ]";6

There is gore, but I don't think it is unnecessary. I didn't like the fact that Mark gets killed so early in the movie...I would have loved to know more about his character, which seemed pretty nice. There was room for improvement and there could have been a better argument about the use that 'women' had for the army guys. Just lust? what about a different approach..survival and preservation of the specie? I mean, at this point the movie turned a bit basic. I expected a more elaborated argument here for it could have become even more profound what was somehow wasted. this part of the movie is indeed, stereotypical but overall it was a film I enjoyed a lot. One thing I found really silly is not the movie, but comments/question I have read in other sites about why 'Frank left his credit card if that could have been of use, later?', c'mon,wasn't it a clearly sarcastic gesture related to the fact that money -given the circumstances- can be of not value at all? What kind of movie people that make those stupid remarks  were watching? Keeping money, or a credit card to 'bribe someone' when the whole country is wiped out and the characters are permanently saying how money is totally useless?

This movie is not complex,but it is never dull either. I wouldn't call it predictable for I believe it is original. I don't think the producers atempted to create an utterly profound movie; still, I believe they wanted to give a different perspective in regards to life, dead and human relationships, without being too heavy or 'trascendental'. To me, they wanted to transmit feeling but just in a light, refreshing way. I did enjoy the performances too, and I believe people who didn't enjoy this movie is probably because they were expecting to see, something that this movie was not meant to be. This film has no overly high pretentions, yet, it was a movie rich in beautiful moments, and diversity of characters. Whenever I watch Meet Joe Black I get a delitghful feeling...

I know some will suggest I say this because I am jealous of her but  it is not jealousy at all  for in my circle of friends most of us are naturally better looking than her (sorry if that sounds arrogant, but it is just true), and many people around the world are! I am sure many girls and guys here will agree with me on this point . Back to the movie.  one great thing about JLo is her smile and her vivacious eyes,and since she has this exotic type, it works well  for this type of movies...movies that are based on stereotypes. Although she is a pretty average actress, in this movie she definitely shines. So, even though I am not her fan, in Maid in Manhattan, I liked her!

Personally, I believe South American movies are better than Mexicans, but I guess Mexican movies are more promoted since, that is the dominant Hispanic culture in the States, where the blockbusters movies come from. Unfortunately, Americans do not really know much about South America and its diversity and assume that all Latin American culture is the same and it is not. Argentina is a country where most of the people comes from European background; thus, their sense of aesthetics is atypical in comparison to most of other Latin American countries. Argentina is a country where Arts and theatre have definitely the highest standards of Latin America. The very famous  Colon Theatre is in Buenos Aires. So, give Argentinian and other South American movies a go!

The Devil's Backbone has a great script, powerful scenes, and manages to be thrilling without the need to recur to tasteless and extreme resources.

Not a typical vampire movie with sexual undertones...it is more than that. Yeah, there was a lot of gore -and I am not someone who enjoys gore for the sake of it, but somehow in this case, it did work. I believe it was also because the art direction was great. That was not the typical vulgar gore but the opposite. There are, however, things that could have been improved...and at times I thought that the vampire language was ridiculous, but then I just ignored it, for saying that is a bit unfair: since they are vampires, an alien language makes sense! We wouldn't expect seeing these vampires speaking English, Chinese, Spanish, or Finish, yeah? so that type of criticism is ridiculous and somehow naive.

Thus, there was a need to think in a new storyline that was also engaging but could survive without those old characters. The plot is different and it may be perceived as forced and lame..Yet when located in the right context it does make sense. I believe the performances were good, and I enjoyed seeing the other side of Michael Corleone...here we see that he was after all human, although he never regretted what he did. In The Godfather I and II his character was all negative. Michael is presented as emotionless, controlling, obsessive, and ruthless. Governed by his ego and desires of revenge. Here...we can see a different side, the one of a lonely man...one that in spite of his power can never be in peace and doesn't seem to get anything he wants no matter what he does. As a result, he questions his means..especially considering the fact that his children have chosen different paths. Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie more than The Godfather II .

The producers were somehow unlucky for, as many people have already observed, this movie was released a few weeks after Sixth Sense, which was unfortunate... because people were still talking about the latter. Quite frankly,  I think this film is  better than The Sixth Sense. It is definitely more frightening, more intense, and much more enjoyable than the other latter one...and Kevin Bacon is of course much, much better actor than Bruce Willis...Kevin is an A and Willis oh well a... B-? Anyway...my purpose is not criticising Willis, there I am going off track, but I merely wanted to share my views about the movie. In a few words: It is a classic! Eerie atmosphere, smart plot, good performances, gripping, believable...and well...you may have a situation like that just next door! ;) If you haven't watch it before, you should definitely do it. Think about this: This movie has no negative reviews, isn't that a great sign?"" ]";6
580;the-full-monty;10;RegOz;/user/RegOz;"[ ""Personally, I think this one of the best comedies ever! A classic! Truly delightful! My son, and I have watched it a few times. He is 11 and he loves it too. He is a pretty selective, intelligent, and sweet boy, who doesn't enjoy gruesome humour, but a sharp and witty one, so he at his age can already distinguish good films from second class, vulgar movies. It is not my intention to be snob, but I find sad the fact that now, what is considered a 'cool' comedy but modern society is often mediocre, silly, tacky, and tasteless. This film, on the other hand, is the opposite. Certainly, there is swearing and there is a bathroom escene that some may not like but it works in its context. The topic is related to sex of course, but I think this movie is outstanding, not only because of the dynamics between the characters and their interplay, but also because it breaks with stereotypes and in its ways, tells us a bit about human resilience. It is not a Hollywood comedy, it is one of those that although are relaxed, engaging and easy to watch, still has profoundity. I will never get sick of it! About the performances : 10 points...and the last part of the movie couldn't be better! Magnificent!"" ]";6

Dialogues are sharp and humorous while there is always an ingredient of sentimentality and nostalgy . The movie deals with themes as frienship, love, passion, betrayal, trust, compassion. Hence, it is much more than just another gay comedy for it is a film that explores the different human dimensions.

The best: Gary Oldman!..and Wynona Rider? she doesn't do much for me anymore, but she did okey! Lucy, was the real star there! The vestuary and Photography are absolutely stunning too, perfect!

Of course I can't say this is a bad movie, for that would be unfair; but it is not, in my opinion, a masterpiece. Tarantino has made himself a name because his movies are different and challenge our ideas of 'normality', but I don't see any greatness' in Pulp Fiction. I didn't find it engaging or profound; I didn't feel it was particularly fun or witty either. I guess most people either like this film or hate it. I am ambivalent about it. I think because of its cinematography, the good performances, and its peculiarity it deserves a 7.

In fact, I disagree, with those who say is trashy, and although some scenes are crude, it is not a torture-porn. To me it is something in between horror and thriller. A good mix, because it makes the plot smar.

It is definitely not a masterpiece, yet the performances and direction are remarkable and won't disappointed. It is not art house but it is not what I would call a typical blockbuster...it is just a movie that discloses a reality that for most of us Westerners is unknown. As I have travelled (as a tourist) through many places in India, this movie has brought to my memory my own experiences up there.  It has also reminded me not only of the beauty of that country but also of its misery; in spite of it, Indian people stays optimistic and proud of its roots. This film succeeds in exploring India's reality. It shows a country in which the difference between deprived and privileged classes is abysmal...but where the hope is not lost...Overall, is not an outstanding movie but it is indeed unforgettable..."" ]";6

951;good-time;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""From the very beginning, the Safdie brothers' Good Time is a very good time. Telling a conventional story in a rather unconventional way, Good Time nonetheless can never escape the banality of its plot, even if its camera work, score, and acting are all top-notch. Directed with great flair and this gritty, television-esque level of grain akin to Dog Day Afternoon, Taxi Driver or Thief, Good Time is a film about a man who needs $10,000 to bail out his brother after the two of them robbed a bank. Given that his brother is mentally handicapped, the problems faced by Constantine Nikas (Robert Pattinson) are only worsened, let alone his own inability to get out of his own way. A classic screw-up character who has a set goal that leads to him breaking the law further in an effort to get out of the hole he dug himself, Good Time blends that with Rain Man or Of Mice & Men in depicting the relationship between Connie and his brother Nick (Ben Safdie). Thrilling from beginning to end, Good Time provides strong genre entertainment but not much else."", ""This conventional story, no matter how much it is told unconventionally, and its cliche characters are truly what holds Good Time back from being a great film. As it stands, it is largely an above average film with some style and flair, but no sense of originality in its writing. It is a director's showcase where the writer's seemed to just fly through the writing of the film after watching a 1970s gritty New York-set crime film marathon. Encountering drugs, people who are all too willing to let a stranger spend the night, fellow criminals, and scummy bail bondsmen, the film's cliche plot - man needs money for any number of reason - tossed in with his cliche inability to make anything work or stick makes the film one that feels as though it has been done many times before. While the characters are fun and easy to sympathize with, they often operate as nothing more than average stock characters. Starring a screw-up with a good heart, a dimwitted brother along for the ride, an anger-filled mess up of a girlfriend who leeches off relatives, and a weird side character who the protagonist meets that introduces a new way for them to possibly make money, Good Time never really feels fresh. Instead, it often falls flat and never really sunk its hooks into me personally. Rather, it felt like a showy and decadent attempt to distract from its plain and run-of-the-mill plot by checking off a list of modern touches that indie audiences adore: neon lights, a synthy score, and a previously disregarded actor firmly establishing themselves as a star in the lead role. As a result, Good Time is never bad, but is never great. Instead, it seems to just settle into being a fun ride while it lasts, but one that will slip away from memory quite rapidly."", ""The film often seems to try and play itself a modern \""edgy\"" drama, akin to moments from Deadpool or Kingsman where it tries to play up the lurid underworld of the characters too much to the point that it tries too hard. Showing this world of crime and drugs, Good Time makes its point pretty quickly that these characters are ones living in a dark world that has them in a terrifying spiral of crime and disorder. Yet, with characters constantly yelling at one another, a BSDM-themed theme park called \""Adventureland\"", and a rough sex scene that seems cut from a porno than reality, the film is like a teenager's attempt to seem mature. By yelling at one's parents and indulging in anything to make its situations seem more x-rated and adult, children often masquerade as adults and will frequently yell out, \""BUT MOM, I'M AN ADULT NOW.\"" At times, Good Time feels like the cinematic equivalent of this annoying not-quite-adult person through its incessant portrayal of items that children believe to be adult, namely with regards to sex and drugs."", ""Driving forward on pure convenience, the film often seems to defy logic throughout with characters acting out scenarios that seem so far removed from reality that they could only occur in a film. Namely, the sequence where Constantine is allowed to stay at this stranger's house with her teenage daughter and no questions are asked. Who, in their right mind, allows just anybody to stay in their home when they are an absolute stranger? The same occurs with the daughter, who proceeds to hang out all night and go to White Castle with these two complete strangers. All of this comes after her seeing the news report about Connie being wanted by the police. In spite of him kissing her, there is no way she missed that report. The bank robbery is also rather implausible, especially with the response by the teller. Only giving a robber what one has in their drawer and then scribbling a note about it is impossible to give them more because of policy is a policy that no bank has. Bank policy regarding robberies is to give the robbers anything they ask for, not stop at the drawer and blame policy for not giving them more."" ]";5
952;personal-shopper;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""After unequivocally loving Olivier Assayas' 2014 effort, Clouds of Sils Maria, his follow-up is a lot tougher of a nut to crack. Part-thriller, part-horror, part-mood piece, Personal Shopper truly evades definition. It operates at a safe distance from the viewer and refuses to be defined. By the end of the film, what is real and what is not real is really next to impossible to pin down. Personally, I have a variety of working theories, but whether or not any of them are actually accurate is another matter in and of itself. What is clear, however, is that this is a film about grief, identity, and mortality. Above all, it is a thriller that sets out to unsettle its audiences and make them think. To do so, Assayas' film is purposefully complex, dense, and tonally off. Even the editing, with many scenes ending abruptly and fading to black, is used to throw off the audience and make us squirm. Of course, this has the by-product of making the film appear to be lacking satisfaction. In many ways, however, this merely mirrors the issues of Maureen (Kristen Stewart) after losing her twin brother Lewis. Complicated, distant, and forever denying viewer access to its idiosyncrasies, it is no wonder that Personal Shopper has divided audiences."", ""One of the most obvious themes that Assayas introduces into the film is grief. Working as a personal shopper for model Kyra (Nora von Waldstätten) to support herself while also operating as a medium for the couple set to move into Lewis' old home, Maureen is constantly looking for a sign. Before he died, the two had promised to leave the other a sign. Whoever died first had to let the other know they were in the afterlife. Waiting around in Paris for Lewis to come give her that sign, she encounters a ghost that is most definitely not Lewis and also begins to receive mysterious text messages from an unknown number. While she is shaken, she approaches every situation where a ghost may be present with the same question: Are you Lewis? She cannot get him off of her mind and is constantly seeking to find out if he is alright and at peace. Assayas' film shows how grief can control one's way of life to the point that she refuses to meet up with boyfriend Gary (Ty Olwin) in Oman for a vacation. Instead, she does a job she hates for a woman she hates just to justify staying in Paris. In essence, she is a prisoner of her grief, which is not an original theme by any means (The Babadook being a recent example), but is well-executed in the film. Assayas injects incredible tension and fear as we wait to find out if the ghosts and noises she encounters are truly Lewis or some other being."", ""However, I have my doubts that Maureen is actually a medium. Whether Lewis was or not is unclear, but towards the end of the film, Maureen remarks how Lewis was always more in tune with that and she usually just copied him. It is entirely plausible that Maureen is not a medium at all. Rather, she is merely a girl suffering from a lost identity due to the shared one she had with Lewis. As he was her twin, it is possible she is trying a route he had taken in order to reach him. However, it does not work and either she meets unfriendly forces or she imagines them all. The latter, however, seems most likely with how awful she is at detecting presences. She notices obvious things in the walls or glasses breaking, but never seems to aware a ghost is with her until it is literally right on top of her. If she were a medium, it would stand to reason that she would be better at identifying when they are near. Furthermore, the ghostly text messages she receives where the sender claims to always be around her and sees what she is doing and wearing, certainly hint that there is a ghost around her. Possibly Lewis, the sender does seem to be a bit odd, but largely harmless for Maureen. However, what is clear is that either Maureen is not a medium or she is an entirely dreadful one, making it unlikely she ever actually encounters ghosts. Rather, it is merely a machination of her mind used to cope with the loss of Lewis in the only way he knew how."", ""One of the most important things that this ghost texter allows her to confront, however, is her sense of identity. Now, this is where this interpretation may lose some people, but I warn you that this is a film that demands multiple views. Coming off of one viewing, it is entirely possible I am off base here. Yet, there are three possible routes to take in regards to Maureen's sense of identity. One is the most logical one based on the film. Through encouraging her to try on Kyra's clothing, the sender allows her to try on a new personality. After expressing that she does not want to be herself, but is unsure who she wants to be, the sender allows her to try out new personalities to find one that fits her."" ]";5
953;a-ghost-story;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Heading into A Ghost Story, one cannot be blamed for assuming it is an examination of grief. With a young husband (Casey Affleck) dying early on and wife (Rooney Mara) mourning his loss, eating pie, and trying to move on without him, it is easy to see how the film is about grief. Yet, in equal measure, it is a film about memory, time, purpose, music, stories, and every little detail that makes life so eternal, so essential, and universal. It is a film about grief shown through the lens of an unexpected protagonist - the ghost under a sheet - who traverses time, space, people, and location. Powerful, poignant, and silently accomplished, A Ghost Story is a rousing return to form for director David Lowery after working for Disney last year. In this low-key, gorgeous, and powerful film, Lowery re-establishes himself as the heir apparent to Terrence Malick's cinematic poetry throne."", ""Silently sewing together images, Lowery's camera frequently finds stunning images. From the very beginning, shots of Affleck's ghost walking through open fields to get back home with the sun peaking over the horizon, the ghost lurking in the background with Mara in the foreground, or the shot of light pouring in as the home is destroyed, A Ghost Story is a film with stunning visuals. This was very much the case with Lowery's prior effort Ain't Them Bodies Saints - which also starred Affleck and Mara - and it is nice to see him return to this gorgeous style. However, compared to that film, Lowery is much less reliant on the beauty of the outdoors to create stunning imagery in A Ghost Story. Rather, he now relies upon drab gray and brown interiors, dark shadows, and a largely gloomy home that is fashioned as a prison cell for this ghost for the rest of eternity until he finds what he has been looking for all this time. Dark, ominous, and spooky, this locale is one that would work for a horror film, but rather, Lowery uses it as a place for existential horror. This ghost is doomed to stay here until he can get the note left behind by Mara that he wants to retrieve, yet he is unable to break through the painted wall to reach the note. Trapped, lonely, and solemn, the ghost's existence is one of little joy, pain (especially when Mara tries to move on), and anger at how he has been so easily forgotten."", ""However, what is perhaps most interesting is how the aspect ratio communicates so much. Lowery himself has stated it was to make the film more claustrophobic to show how trapped the ghost is in this home, but that is just scratching the surface. With a squareish frame and rounded edges with drab colors, the film often looks like an old photograph. This is particularly pertinent due to the film's thoughts regarding memories and the little pieces of ourselves that we leave behind. Being remembered, our memories, and our brief time on Earth after which we are forgotten forever, are all constantly on the mind of A Ghost Story throughout. Mara leaving little notes of things she likes in houses she moves from, the quiet mourning of her husband, and a party guest speaking about memory and Beethoven, all exemplify this element of the film. Yet, what is abundantly clear in A Ghost Story is that time does not matter. It will advance, things will be left behind, people die, and people move on to other places. In the end, the only thing that does matter are the little pieces of ourselves we leave in the hearts and souls of those we touch. As Affleck silently lingers in the background with Mara eating a piece of pie, this fact is felt. She does not need to say anything, nor does he. Both miss one another and it is not because they existed, were in that home, or were even because they were married. Rather, it is because they both touched one another's lives and, now, circumstance and a freak accident have taken them apart from one another. Instead of holding one another, they now are left wallow in the solitude and thickness of the air in the home as they try to soothe the hole in their hearts."", ""With a minimal script that often amounts to a character standing stationary for a period of time to the ambitious time traveling finale, A Ghost Story is a film that is nearly impossible to not compare to the work of Malick. Yet, it is not just in the style and ambition that Lowery manages to capture the feeling of Malick's best works, but also in the feelings they emote. The best Malick films, such as The Tree of Life, are ambitious and show life from the very beginning to the present day with a silent, melodic, and poetic flow to the proceedings. A Ghost Story is very much the same way. Instead of being a typical narrative film, A Ghost Story is often best described as visual poetry.

954;the-big-sick;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""In writing, it is said that it is best to write what you know. That way, you can bring that authentic and real emotion, feeling, and touch to the events depicted. Perhaps no recent film has better embodied this than The Big Sick. Though directed by Michael Showalter, this is really Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon's show. The married pair of screenwriters who sat down and put the story of their meeting, Emily's illness, the issues regarding a Pakistani immigrant and American girl dating, and their eventual reunion. Wherever they may take liberties with their own story to make it more cinematic - if these moments exist - does nothing to stamp out the way in which the film deftly handles a variety of issues. Whatever bridge is tries to cross, it does so running. Finding the comedy in joy, sadness, pain, rejection, and anxiety, The Big Sick is often a profound and moving experience, but is always a thoroughly enjoyable one. How it manages to become this is because of one simple fact: Nanjiani and Gordon were there, so they know how it all felt."", ""Kumail Nanjiani is this romantic comedy with Zoe Kazan starring as Kumail's real wife, Emily. A Pakistani immigrant, Kumail is a stand-up comedian who must cope with his family's strict religious beliefs and fervent desire for him to meet a Pakistani girl. Along the way, he meets cute with Emily and the two quickly hit it off. In portraying the issues Kumail has with his family and how it impacts his relationship, The Big Sick benefits greatly from being written by those who experienced the feeling. As a result of Kumail's family, their relationship is highly complex. If they stay together, then Kumail is exiled from his family and Emily feels remorse for being the cause behind him losing his family. However, if they keep their relationship hidden as Kumail intends, then Emily is hurt as it makes it feel as though he does not want her in the way that she wants him. It is a slippery slope and one that must be confronted. Having everyone walk away happy is likely improbable due to the steep barrier of culture keeping them apart. Worsening the situation is all of the little intricacies of which they remain blissfully unaware, highlighted by Kumail having to constantly explain arranged marriage to Emily and those around them. This gulf in culture, no matter how Americanized Kumail has become, will always be there and must be approached cautiously by both sides."", ""Where the film really soars, however, is when Emily is not even there. Zoe Kazan is fantastic, but the film becomes quite profound when Kumail is thrust into a situation where he must cope with Emily's illness and meeting her parents. Terry (Ray Romano) and Beth (Holly Hunter) rush from North Carolina to care for their daughter as she fights off a mystery illness and also meet Kumail for the first time. Reeling from the two breaking up due to Kumail's unwillingness to lose his family and Emily's unwillingness to make him lose his family, it is a rather awkward situation for him with Beth knowing all of the sordid details, including Kumail's lying and dishonesty regarding his family. Thus, tensions run quite high initially before they come to bond over one thing: Emily. Their love, care, fear, and pain, that is shared with each ebb and flow of her illness and the frustration felt when the doctors are clueless, brings them together. They reach deep within themselves to overcome this and the writing by Nanjiani and Gordon is raw, emotional, and powerful. This area is perhaps mostly driven by Nanjiani considering Gordon was not there, but the film nonetheless captures the emotions of everybody involved brilliantly. Watching a loved one fight an illness is a truly helpless feeling, worsened when doctors are unsure why it is happening (which is always). The Big Sick never feels exploitative, is smartly written in this arena, and captures both the light moments that bring a smile to your face - Beth showing old high school photos of Emily in her \""goth phase\"" to Kumail - and the shared sadness when the news is particularly hard. All of this culminates into the greatest release: Emily overcoming his illness."", ""Though a true story and obviously going to end up with Kumail and Emily being together, the film smartly never falls into the trap of rushing them back together when she overcomes her illness. As she fights, the film lays the groundwork for this in its inclusion of Terry's infidelity. It is clear before this reveal that Terry and Beth are constantly at one another's throats. In hearing it from Terry, he was forgiven by her but she never let go of it and never was able to overcome her hurt from his transgression. For his part, he still hates himself for what he did to her. It is a slow process of healing for their relationship with both sleeping in separate beds. Taking years of healing, The Big Sick sums it up quite neatly with Beth coming back into Terry's bed, but it highlights the slow build-up."" ]";5
955;baby-driver;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""After releasing a film every three years since 2004, director Edgar Wright's latest effort comes after a four-year gap due to his flirtations with Ant-Man. Baby Driver, an action film about a man named Baby (Ansel Elgort) who is a getaway driver, is perhaps Wright's most commercially appealing film. With the box office to match and the film shaping up to a box office surprise to many this summer, it seems as though Wright has finally found some mainstream acceptance, at least in America. As with many directors who finally escape niche audiences and finally find themselves receiving applauds from the general public (without having to resort to their work being a \""cult classic\""), Wright has unfortunately compromised some of the frenetic fun of his early work. Though Baby Driver is nonetheless a quirky, funny, and often times surreal film, it winds up feeling wholly underwhelming with Wright ditching what made his earlier films work so well: characters."", ""Though Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz were both action comedies, they nonetheless had great central characters. The supporting cast got the same treatment in those action films and this was especially true in his other works, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and The World's End. Unfortunately, this latest work gives very little for any character. Baby, a music-loving kid with tinnitus and who is in love with Debora (Lily James), is given very little depth even as the star. Beyond having a black foster dad and dead parents, it is hard to imagine what was supposed to be learned about the kid. He does not really grow and is never really given room to explore any bit of him beyond brief flashbacks to the car crash that gave him tinnitus and killed his parents along with a cassette tape that has a recording of his mom (Sky Ferreira) singing. Too often, Wright seems to rely upon old school musical classics as a shortcut to actually write dialogue between characters or characters' backstories. It is often excusable when the supporting cast is lightly developed or if a film fails to develop many characters beyond narrative cliches when there is not a single protagonist. Unfortunately, beyond being a good kid with a bad past that has led to him being bound to crime boss Doc (Kevin Spacey) as a getaway driver, Baby gets no depth or nuance. As a result, it is easy to just roll your eyes with how pale he winds up being written."", ""This same problem is found with the entirety of the supporting cast. His girlfriend, Debora, is shown as being nothing more than idyllic yes man who does whatever Baby tells her to do. Leave work now? Sure. Travel the country right now with a guy you barely know? Sure. Let this guy just follow you home? Of course. She has no ideas of her own. No volition and, crucially, no motivation. Wright, likely, keeps it this way to make it easier to turn her into a stone cold badass at the end with her taking on Buddy (Jon Hamm) and trying to outrun the cops. Neither are convincing moments with how she is set up as nothing more than a young girl trying to make a living at a dead end job. Wright treats her as arm candy, lets her have a moment towards the end, and then reassures the audience she is nothing more than a dream girl from a song and relegates her to being nothing more than cute for trying to save Baby, but let's let the men handle this one, eh? For Doc, he suffers from the same issue, but in reverse. Though he does seem to always like Baby, his turn from a hard-nosed criminal who will never let go of Baby to a soft and sentimental man who sacrifices himself to save his beloved driver is borderline comical. The film may be an action-comedy, but its absurd and ludicrous suggestion that Debora could go from quiet waitress to being Bonnie and Doc could go from being a true monster to being Sulley from Monsters Inc. carries no water. These two, despite their vital importance to the plot, are woefully underwritten. For bank robbers Buddy, Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), and Bats (Jamie Foxx), they are similarly underwritten. All of them are crazy and impulsive with no depth for any of the trio ever being considered. They are just nuts and cannot be trusted. With them all being treated as villains of Baby by the end, this cast of underwritten villains makes it apparent why Wright wanted to work with Marvel: his lack of knowledge of how to write a capable villain would be welcomed, instead of questioned. The only saving grace with the villain is a good motivation for why they become the villain, but it comes off of the back of too little development until then to really make it click."" ]";5
956;wonder-woman;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Calling this the best film released as part of the DC Extended Universe thus far is a rather easy task, but does Wonder Woman rise to the level of being a good film? Well, probably not. It is not bad (BVS) or one of the worst things that could ever be imagined (Suicide Squad), but Wonder Woman is still not some kind of a good movie. It is close though and decidedly \""above average\"" as Chris Pine's Steve Trevor so neatly offers to describe both his looks and the film's quality. So what is the god killer in Patty Jenkins' first foray into the world of Wonder Woman? After firing and missing on its two most recent efforts, the DCEU lightened things up, but avoided the true cause of death: cliches. There is hardly anything original about the villain or other plot happenings and the film is crushed under this predictable weight. It is a beautiful looking film nonetheless, but it remains a rather pale and typical superhero film blended with a female empowerment picture."", ""It is in the latter that the film is perhaps the most muddled. As Diana/Wonder Woman's (Gal Gadot) encounters with the outside world begin in a \""fish out of water\"" type fashion (featuring the requisite jokes to highlight how out of touch she is), she is treated very woman-like. Steve tries to save her from any danger and brings her to buy clothes. It is eerily reminiscent of Mila Kunis in Jupiter Ascending who, though she is known as the one who can save the world, spends 60% of the film cleaning toilets. Here, Diana is spared the scrubbing of an inner bowl, but is nonetheless forced into a womanly hole of having to wear flashy dresses and to act like a woman. Naturally, this all comes after Steve has seen her kick ass while in the Amazonian world. No matter, eventually the men will come around, correct? Wrong. Instead, every man that surrounds her consistently tries to hold her back, hold her hand and lead her around, or shield her with their bodies. With comments about how attractive she is and jokes about how attractive she and her friends are, the film further makes one wonder if this is really a female empowerment picture. Yes, women kick ass in Wonder Woman, but they are never treated as the equals of men. Even the dialogue uttered by Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) about the world describes it as the \""world of men\"". The line about how men are useless besides procreation is a bit too much in the opposite direction (more about emasculation of men than it is empowerment of women). All in all, the film gives her room to take people down, but she is never given credit for her actions in a way that does not sound like \""pretty good for a woman\"". Compared to Gamora or Black Widow, Wonder Woman is never able to not be a woman. Instead, every line and action by those around her serves as a reminder that, yes, she is a woman."", ""If the dialogue did not remind you, perhaps the camera work will. As Laura Mulvey so perfectly defined, this film is very much the product of internalized sexism. With camera work that focuses on Gal Gadot's ass and with the camera working its way up from the bottom to allow the scopophilic audience to soak in every inch of our superhero. For a film with marketing so focused on showing her to be a beacon of female strength, it seems rather fine with having her represent to-be-lookedatness and the result of the male gaze by the camera and the audience. Yes, the film tosses in Chris Pine naked once, but for a film about a woman and for women, it seemed more interested in objectifying Diana than Steve. In a similar vein, the scantily clad costume design is both problematic and not. For one, it is too much and only allows the camera to soak in more skin. On the other, Steve tries to get her to change because she is so scantily clad, which is equally problematic. If she is comfortable, why change? She should be wearing more clothes because, if it is armor, why must she wear a skimpy skirt and not full body armor like male superheroes and warriors? But, forcing her to change to be appropriate is like the film recognizing it is absurd, but also taking away her own autonomy when it comes to deciding what she can and cannot wear, giving control of that to her male love interest."", ""The film's stereotypical approach to women may be crushingly disappointing based upon expectations, but what is perhaps worse is how awful the villain winds up being. Turns of Ares is just a pissed of British guy who wants to destroy the world like every other villain in a superhero movie. Given no development beyond a desire to kill the world and having killed Zeus and other gods to follow through on this, the chief villain here is rather dull and, worse, is killed by the power of love. Gaining superpowers from grief and love in a scene that plays out like the \""Save Martha\"" one from Batman v Superman, Diana is finally able to overcome him by, as she later describes herself, by discovering that love conquers all."" ]";5

Whether they expected more of a monster movie or a comedic take on one, Colossal winds up missing the mark on both, simply because it is not necessarily either. Using elements of monster movies and comedy to tell its tale, Colossal is a genre bending film with a character study core as it examines the life of its lead character, her problems, and how she became who she is today. To do this, it does use a monster terrifying Seoul, but it is merely a device through which we learn about our protagonist and the people in her life. Smartly written with top-notch acting all around, Colossal is a surprisingly satisfying film that will make you laugh, but also  terrify, thrill, and entertain you with everything in its arsenal. It is, essentially, the swiss army knife of films. This, naturally, has its limitations, but writer/director Nacho Vigalondo deftly blending everything together into a cohesive and highly rewarding film is a practically miraculous achievement."", ""Colossal tells the story of Gloria (Anne Hathaway). An out-of-work alcoholic, Gloria abuses the trust of boyfriend Tim (Dan Stevens) and makes a mockery of his hospitality in light of her financial status. Tim opts to show her some tough love by kicking her out and breaking up with her. Returning to her small hometown, Gloria pitches her tent in her parents' empty house, which is being rented out at the moment. While there, she runs into old elementary school friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) and, while paling around with him and his friends, scores a job as a bartender at the bar owned by Oscar. The only hitch in this newfound success? At 8:05 in South Korea, if Gloria walks through a playground near her home, she will appear as a huge monster and terrorize the people of Seoul. As we quickly learn, Oscar has the same affliction, appearing as a large robot. Becoming a global phenomenon, the film finds great comedy and excitement in the hysteria by showing the internet's reaction to the insanity, as well as the sheer bloody carnage created by Gloria and Oscar without any intent on their part."", ""Yet, these kaijus are merely a gateway into the psyches of Colossal's protagonists. Peering into why both Gloria and Oscar are undeniably broken people, the film borders on becoming a thriller at moments, as well as being a fully-fledged character study. Tracing their current predicament with an event 25 years prior, which was also the first time the monster was seen in Seoul, Colossal shows just how deeply unhappy and self-loathing its characters are. A woman who got fired from her job as a writer and apparently faced some harassment online over it, Gloria feels inadequate and depressed. Fighting to be heard and stand tall as an individual, Gloria feels personally attacked whenever things go wrong or a situation turns sour, in part because she lacks the confidence in herself to really follow through on anything. As a result, she drowns her sorrows in a bottle in order to forget her past and allow her to not be consumed with the crushing weight of being a failure after having so many expectations placed upon her after getting out of her small town."", ""On the other side, Oscar is a much darker character. Deeply disturbed, obsessed with Gloria, and caught in a vicious cycle of self-loathing that sees him exact his self-hatred on the world in order to vent, Oscar is a surprisingly dark and terrifying man. Gloria is taken aback by this, but Colossal quickly establishes just how much he envies her for having achieved so much by simply leaving the town. Pointing to the death of his mother - of whom he has a photo with her face scratched out - as the event that made Oscar turn, Colossal shows how Oscar seems to play Gloria for all of the inadequacy her feels and the sense that he is a complete failure. Lashing out at her and his friends, Oscar runs everybody off purely because of the violent and passionate hate he feels for himself."", ""As a result of this characterization, we see how destructive their personalities and situations are. Though Gloria and Oscar suffer from their own issues, the people most impacted by their problems are those around them. They are greatly destructive people, both literally and figuratively squashing every opportunity, friendship, and relationship, set before them purely because they cannot get out of their own way and are consumed with their self-loathing. If they simply looked down and watched what they were stepping on, they may be able to catch themselves and stop before causing too much damage. However, like a kaiju, they simply stomp about and ruin every life they encounter along the way. A smart usage of kaijus to personify the inner demons of a person and the damage it can cause for those they love and hold dear, Colossal handles the issue in the proper way"" ]";5
958;a-quiet-passion;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Distance, verbose, and complex, A Quiet Passion is the cinematic version of its subject's poetry. Elusive in definition due to both its complexity and a to-the-grave reliance upon a mental thesaurus, A Quiet Passion is a film that actively rejects audience understanding in the name of honoring the brilliance of its protagonist. However, by never letting us in to understand her plight - one certainly driven out typical artist's plight, in which their work is never appreciated during their own life, to the point that they wonder if their life's passion was worthwhile or not - from her point of view, A Quiet Passion winds up being far too subtle and lacking in clarity with regard to how one should feel about Emily Dickinson (Cynthia Nixon) at the end of the film. On one hand, she is a brilliant writer, even if well beyond my own comprehension. Yet, on the other hand, she was certainly quite self-absorbed and assured that she was better than those around her, even if their supposed faults were also her own. By the end, A Quiet Passion is a handsomely crafted film that simply lacks enough clarity and comprehensibility to truly become an excellent film."", ""Verbosely written with the script relying heavily upon a bevy of SAT words, A Quiet Passion borders on pretension in how it consistently over-complicates its story with its reliance upon complex language. At times, the film can lose track of even itself with how many words it tries to pull out of the thesaurus, all in the name of communicating the extensive vocabulary possessed by Dickinson. Fortunately, Cynthia Nixon often brings this back to Earth in a terrific performance. Displaying Dickinson's sharp, if dry, wit and ability to tear down on an opponent in verbal combat, the film's writing uses the dictionary quite nicely in those moments, but can otherwise force the rest of the film into being quite the slog. No matter how hard I tried to understand it all, the film always seemed to be attempting to become more-and-more complicated to the detriment of the overall product. It defied understanding and actively sought to complicate its rather straight-forward adherence to biopic formula."", ""This adherence to biopic formula is further demonstrated in the film's brevity. Issues arise and quickly fall into the backdrop in the name of telling her entire story. Scenes of the aunt with the family play in isolation, the Civil War is thrown in with mention of various battles and their casualties, the parents come and go, Emily's illness is hinted at and then results in her death, but it never really all comes together into a cohesive product. It is quite pleasant to watch with how exquisitely shot it all is, but it feels more like a highlight reel of Dickinson's life than an honest attempt to teach us about her and her work. Compared to other recent biopics such as Jackie which pick a point in time or two to base its storytelling around and, as a result, are given the space to develop its central character and create a base level of understanding that person and their life as a whole, A Quiet Passion never really captures Dickinson. It just tosses in moments from her life with Davies exacerbates moments with long-takes in an attempt to try and express the unspoken depth of the film. In the end, it winds up just feeling rather hollow."", ""The film's storytelling prowess is only worsened by the awkward inclusion of Dickinson's poetry. Narrated by Nixon as Dickinson writes or simply as she does something, the moments never really flow into the rest of the film. Instead, it feels like an overall diversion that never really works. While the poetry is beautiful - even if similarly elusive as the film itself - it simply does not work into the film as smoothly as it could and, as a result, the film's abbreviated approach to her life is met with a fractured approach to storytelling that lacks flaw and is far rockier than one would have expected when opting to watch the film."", ""However, though Dickinson's characterization is increasingly elusive and distant, A Quiet Passion's moments of developing her are well-taken with Davies really shining a light on her, even if it not really positive. Born in a time where women were expected to be docile and unquestioning, she was a powerful feminist voice arguing for equality. Citing that as her reasoning for not wanting to marry - equality - Dickinson is mostly a recluse. As her sister Vinnie (Jennifer Ehle) warns her in beginning, we often become what we do not want to become. For Emily, she does not want to become enslaved to another, but mostly does not want to become her mother. Long suffering, prone to crying, and a hermit, her mother is somebody she loves, but wishes to never become. Unfortunately, by the end of the film, it is clear that her own pretension has relegated her to a life of isolation like that of her mother. For Vinnie, this means she must be a doting sister at the beck and call of her sister, out of love."" ]";5

Yet, after watching, it is a film that may lose some steam along the way, but it works. Stylish, strongly directed, and terrifically acted, Free Fire manages to invest us in this brief moment at the end of these characters' lives as they engage in a shootout in Boston. Arising out of a weapons deal where one of the men selling the merchandise recognizes one of the buyers as the guy who \""bottled\"" his female cousin and the wrong guns were provided, this hour plus long shootout in an old warehouse is thrilling, engaging, and often quite shocking to watch. Never shying away from violence or unexpected deaths or unexpected characters, Wheatley's film is one that attempts to re-invigorate the action-comedy genre with the kind of spirit found in the work of Quentin Tarantino, but minus all of that distracting plot. Free Fire gets to the good bits and then let's this attractive cast bleed all over the set instead. Like a lead-infused musical, Free Fire hits the right notes and creates sweet music as the bullets fly."", ""Though never particularly deep - throw-away lines regarding the place of the sale being an old warehouse that made things nobody wants anymore or Brie Larson's anger regarding the \""bottling\"" of some girl do not count - Wheatley is still able to make this one have great depth due to smart writing. Ditching the obvious and ham-fisted symbolism of his prior feature, Wheatley instead makes an action film that develops characters through bullets. With each shot defining loyalty and each line delivering some crucial element of the character, Wheatley is able to somehow make us care about people who should, given the lack of real plot or depth, be rather unmemorable. Yet, many stand out in their own way and become quite easy to root for. Given the size of the cast and often chaotic shooting in this warehouse, it could be easy to lose track of everybody, but the fact that each character feels distinct and distinguishable from one another is quite the achievement. Though it may seem a bit facetious or a low-bar for a film, it is all too often that even character-driven or plot-heavy films begin to lose track of who everybody is and what they mean for the story. Free Fire, however, never has this issue and instead develops its character smartly, without any kerfuffle, and without out any distraction. Instead, it neatly introduces them all, gives them all motivation, shows their bonds or lack thereof with the other characters, and then gives them a gun to fight their way out. Tight and smart, the characters in Free Fire are exactly what they need to be and that is all that can be asked."", ""Of course, the acting certainly goes a long way in bringing about this appeal for the characters, as the strong acting across-the-board often serves to breathe life and individuality into these characters. As manic gun runner Vernon, Sharlto Copley brings a real wild card element to this film and plays this crazed lunatic incredibly well. Compared to the more straight-laced Justine (Brie Larson) or business-focused Chris (Cillian Murphy), Vernon's insane gun runner is one that brings that fun and care-free element to the film that often makes it such a joy to watch. For their parts, Larson and Murphy also deliver typically strong performances. Alongside them, Armie Hammer's dapper and charismatic Ord may not be totally out of his range, but it is nonetheless yet another role that he really nails. An incredibly unsung actor somehow, Hammer's laid back charisma is one that makes him easy to believe as a middle man between two criminal organizations, who is responsible for setting up the sale. In a smaller role, Sam Riley continues to scream out for roles akin to the one he received as the lead in Anton Corbijn's Control. Somehow sympathetic - perhaps just because I do like Riley's work - and absolutely insane as scumbag Steveo, Riley gives an unhinged and rage-infused performance that hits all the right notes."", ""Stylistically, Free Fire is an impeccably crafted film with excellent lighting. Relying upon the orange-tinted lighting of the warehouse to provide all of the visibility in the film, the orange tint is appealing visually, but perfect for capturing the era. Set in, presumably, 1970s Boston, the terrific costume design naturally captures much of this, but the lighting further adds to this appeal. Giving it the look of an old photo or a dimly dreamscape of insanity, this orange hue is what defines the look of the film and what adds much of its visual appeal. Wheatley, additionally, injects style via how the shootout is framed. With tight shots of the characters as they hide behind various obstacles, the film rarely shows where the other characters are in relation to whomever is in the shot."" ]";5

Set in 1940, Their Finest focuses on the efforts of the British Ministry of Information to make a film about the war that is both authentic and optimistic. They did not want to beat around the bush of how horrible things could be, but wanted to show that their boys could overcome these challenges, thereby creating confidence and support for the war. In the midst of this production process, Scherfig's film often mirrors the effort to be \""authentic and optimistic\"", but not just for the war. Rather, about women's roles in society and their ability to be everything a man can be and possibly even do it better than their male counterparts. Featuring an excellent cast, Their Finest is an terribly funny film that is not afraid to show the carnage of 1940s London during the air raids and the problems faced by women in workforce."", ""Focused on Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton), Their Finest shows her various problems. Her boyfriend/husband Ellis (Jack Huston) does not respect her and takes it as a personal affront when she gets a job as the writer of female lines for that aforementioned war film. The government pays her less than men because there is no way they could pay her as much as a man. Main writer Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin) admits they need a female writer to write the \""slop\"" aka female dialogue. As with many men of the time period, he clearly does not value what a woman could bring, also denigrating Phyl Moore (Rachael Stirling) for being, what he thinks, a \""Ministry spy\"" who reports on the ongoing writing process. Actor Ambrose Hilliard (Bill Nighy) thinks she is an adoring fan when she first tries to give him notes on a scene. Yet, by the end of the film, everybody recognizes something: she has a unique voice and must be heard. She is a woman, yes, but she is capable of writing a great film just like any man could. Her tireless efforts are what turned their film, \""The Nancy Starling\"" into not just great propaganda, but a film that captured what the war meant. From showing older people lose their grandsons after losing sons in the first war to men trying to be heroes and to women trying to help any way they reasonably can despite the obstacles put in their way, her film is an embodiment of the British spirit at the time and showcases her skills as a screenwriter."", ""While its feminist themes may be a little on-the-nose, Scherfig nimbly weaves them into this wartime tale with a plot that often follows the same beats as the one that Catlin is writing for the government. As a result, however, her film touches on the same themes. In depicting the struggles of women throughout history and of a wartorn Britain, Their Finest spares no punches. We see men get blown up. People lose loved ones constantly in this film. Yet, together, it is possible to rise above. It is tragic and you can of course grieve their loss, but it does not define you and it can be something to grow and overcome down the line. No matter the obstacles before you, through unity and individual strength, everything can be overcome. In essence, the film is \""authentic and optimistic.\"""", ""To accent these moments of heavy-hitting drama, Scherfig capably inserts plenty of comedy that hits all the right notes. Never forced and always naturally introduced, the film relies upon the charisma of its actors to make its quick jokes really come off, especially Bill Nighy. Turning in a masterful performance as a self-absorbed veteran actor who sees it as his duty to act in the place of the young men who are at war, Nighy is not just a master of the dramatic moments, but makes the comedy really click due to great delivery. While the film does not always meet its aspirations of being a modern screwball comedy, Nighy is one character who really demonstrates a capability in screwball comedy with zippy dialogue that finds comedy in otherwise mundane comments."", ""Perhaps one of the film's more divisive moments could be its insistence on including elements of production and writing the movie the film is about, which could be seen as too manipulative at trying to get movie lovers interested in the film. Yet, while a bit manipulative, it works entirely. Their Finest is practically porn for movie lovers. Showing the writing process between Catlin and Tom, the on-location sequences at Dunkirk with some great jokes and dramatic moments for Nighy during the shooting, and the studio sequences, Their Finest walks you from conception to release and it is always captivating. The changes the film takes, how it willfully plays with reality to tell a better story, and how it all comes together in the end after heavy editing to pander to various audiences, Their Finest is a modern day take on Hollywood and the production process that really hits all the right notes. I love films about Hollywood and making movies with Their Finest being no exception."" ]";5

However, when he creates a friendship with a member of the Israeli parliament who goes onto become Prime Minister of Israel, Misha Eshel (Lior Ashkenazi), Norman is at the brink of making it all come together. Now, he just has to hustle to really be a king. He has to get Misha's son into Harvard using the fact that Philip went to Harvard and still has ties to the admissions counsel. For Philip, he has to get Rabbi Blumenthal (Steve Buscemi) to officiate his wedding to a Korean convert. For the Rabbi, he has to get Bill Kavish (Dan Stevens) to convince his wealthy boss to donate enough money to save the Rabbi's synagogue. For Bill and his boss, he has to get Misha to introduce them to a person within the United States treasury department. Juggling all of these balls only to get caught up in a bribery investigation with regard to Misha and having to overcome his appearance of being a loser, Norman quickly begins to experience his tragic fall."", ""With everybody on his back for not delivering what he has promised due to the fact that Misha's assistants have cut Norman off from contact with the Prime Minister, Norman is faced with failure after failure. Doors he could once sneak through are now slammed shut with people turning against him from every angle. The only thing that could make it worse is prior acquaintance Alex Green (Charlotte Gainsbourg) investigating the Prime Minister and Norman for an illegal business relationship between the two. Having realized he is a loser after being hounded by a man named Srul Katz (Hank Azaria) in a similar way to how he stalked men such as Bill Kavish earlier in the film, Norman is already down and out. His options are limited and this is where this character study really succeeds. While his mightily slow rise to the top is quite plainly written and hardly reveals anything about anybody, his tragic fall shows how cruel humanity can be. Everybody knew he could not deliver, but turn against him at the end and chastise him. They cut him off and even the Rabbi beats him up in an alley. He is destitute and backed against a wall. He has realized he is not a businessman, but just another bum on the streets. There is nothing to live for and there is nobody there for him. It is in this solitude where Gere acts the hell out of this role with a slow and labored realization of the truth. His solemn and reserved nature, hiding his inner turmoil, is powerful to watch unfold and fitting of the word \""tragic\"". Until the film is able to reach this tragic fall, however, its moderate rise is rather dull and safe. It has moments of light comedy with an awkward score that is light and bubbly, which is wholly ill-fitting for its on-screen events. Norman is mostly an unlikable character who we can all see is a loser, but has none of the self-recognition yet. Its introduction to this world is far too labored and exposition-heavy to really compel or grip us, instead belaboring the point that nobody will talk to him and that he goes to creepy lengths to find business partners. Its first two acts are essentially just the same as any other independent film from the past few years about a man who is struggling and unable to really see that he is not treading water, but rather is drowning rapidly. Its painfully plain opening is just too safe and run-of-the-mill to really work beyond the strong performance from Gere in this portion."" ]";5

Facing horrific conditions in the jungle and squaring off with the naturally confused and hesitant natives of the land, the men - for all of their faults - embarked on a journey that changed the course of human history. Yet, being willing to embark on such a journey naturally calls for a man that is willing to get away. One that is willing to leave his homeland and take on such an arduous with the odds being against him ever returning home again. Either disease or conflicts with the natives would prove to be the end for him and others in his party and, as such, is always a journey to find more than a city or explore a civilization. It is a calling for people that are missing something and want to find something in those jungles that is more than a city of gold. What they hope to find is unknown to even them and is one that will undoubtedly forever change their life."", ""Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) was one such man. Initially sent to Bolivia on behalf of the Royal Geographical Society and British Army in order to end a border dispute between Bolivia and Brazil over where the border actually is between the two, Fawcett quickly becomes obsessed with the Amazonian jungle. In his initial mission to find the source of a river known to the British that holds the key to where the border lies, he stumbles across pottery and a carving in a tree. Around him is nothing but jungle, except for these small trinkets. Upon returning to Britain, he immediately calls for his return to find a lost city he is calling “Zed”. Despite the fact that his wife Nina (Sienna Miller) is pregnant with their second child and his son Jack (soon to be Tom Holland) does not remember him, Percy believes he must go back to the jungle. With the backing of a few investors, he does set out to find this lost city, returning with Corporal Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson), Corporal Arthur Manley), and explorer James Murray (Angus Macfayden). Upon there, illness and a loss of rations prevent them from completing the journey. Finally, years later after spending time in France for World War I, he returns with son Jack to complete his journey for this lost city."", ""However, in spite of its apparent set-up as a film about a man embarking on a life’s journey to find a city and throwing away his family in the process, The Lost City of Z is mostly a character study. Percy Fawcett is a man who has made Major in the British Army at the beginning of the film, but without a medal. He has received some distinctions in the past, but is the only man to have the rank of Major without a medal. Compounded by the fact that his father was a drunk with an infamous reputation that ruined the Fawcett name, Percy first accepts the surveying mission to Bolivia in an effort to restore his name. Calls from Britain for him to return immediately due to adverse conditions on his first trip are met with stubbornness from Percy, who insists on completing the mission given to them nonetheless. Though he loves his wife Nina and loves his children, he is on a search to find himself in this Amazonian jungle. He feels destiny calling him with even a psychic he visits in the trenches of World War I telling him that his soul will never rest until he finds what he is looking for in the jungle. To Percy, this means the lost city. If he just finds the city, he will be okay and will stop hearing the voice in his head to run. However, what he is running to is an illusion. There has been a possible city found there in this century, but it is not what was calling Fawcett. His call what one of self-identity. Who is he? He has no rank. His father was a drunk. All he has is this city and it is the only accomplishment he could ever dream of having that will define his destiny and leave a mark on the world. If he could find this city, he would be remembered and revered for his bravery.

Though fast paced, it never annoys, while providing bright colors and fun sequences for the target child audience. But, in this spate of incredible energy, The Lego Batman Movie touches on important themes of teamwork, togetherness, and family, that should have a profound impact on children. For adults, the dirtier jokes and the constant fan service with Batman, and the critique of DC films (\""brooding\"" as a Batman trait, mocking the premise of Suicide Squad) will more than provide enough entertainment. Above all, however, the film truly strikes a sweet spot from being self-referential and corny without slipping into becoming annoying a la last year's Deadpool. This is a self-aware superhero satire done right with funny jokes, good action, and tremendous animation."", ""With Will Arnett anchoring the film with a hysterically selfish and narcissistic take on Batman, Arnett finds some great pieces to the character when he is not just spitting punch lines. Though the punch lines work, the film would tire quickly if it were just a barrage of jokes. Rather, via Batman, the film finds a heart akin to a Pixar film. Lonely and caught in a constant spiral of self-loathing that culminates with a new Batman film being released, the character lives a life of solitude. At times vulnerable, but always lashing out as a result of his inner anger, Arnett does well to play a man who is self-aware. He knows he is alone, but his vanity and pride do not allow him to admit it out loud. His obsession over his abs is vain, yes, but also heavily compensating for how inadequate of a person he feels like without a family to call his own. Though Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) is there for him, he is so blind for self-hatred, this point is lost on him. As a side bar, Fiennes is a brilliant selection for Alfred and does tremendously in the role."", ""Though the film explains its themes of loneliness, family, and teamwork with no subtlety, it never feels preachy because it is a kids movie. Though the parents get it, the kids do need Ellie Kemper's Phyllis, guardian of the Phantom Zone, the explain to us what makes people good or bad and how people can change. On-the-nose, the film never suffers or feels hokey, rather it is a good time for the adults to calm down and relax from the frenetic pace of the film."", ""The frenetic pace of the film is not a constant though. Some of the best scenes in the film are ones highlighting Batman's loneliness. An extended shot that has to be somewhere near a minute long or more (a lifetime in this film) of Batman just sitting in his indoor pool eating lobster is absolutely hysterical. Him warming up the lobster and getting his mail also hits comedy highs for its critique of the mundanity of life. It highlights just how plain his life is, but makes him so relatable to the audience and shows that, no matter who you are, the Pennysaver winds up in the mailbox and you always hit the wrong numbers on the microwave the first time. The simple comedy of this film is a pleasure to watch unfold and, though not revolutionary, it is incredible fun and really works in the film with great comedic delivery and director Chris McKay willing to take his time with jokes."", ""That said, the film's most fervent energy comes into the form of constant references. A who's who of properties that Warner Bros or Lego have their hands in with villains coming left, right, and center, from the 80s, 90s, and 00s, the film is a nerd's dream. Much of the hilarity comes the sheer number of villains introduced - both from Batman's world and others - as well as those that are not real, but included anyways as a punchline.

It may not be revolutionary, but director Chris McKay does a great job capturing the action and finding innovative ways to utilize the use of legos in the battle and in the aftermath of action sequences (fire). Interestingly, the film also shows the need for evil as the presence of evil ensures the rise of good to overcome evil. In this way, the character of the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) is used incredibly well and his actions in regards to the plot work incredibly well with this recurring theme."", ""Featuring a stellar voice cast, The Lego Batman Movie is a terrifically animated affair that is pure energy."" ]";5
964;t2-trainspotting;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""It has been a fair while since I watched Danny Boyle's Trainspotting, but T2 Trainspotting is nonetheless a welcomed return to Edinburgh, where we find our protagonists from the first film. While possessing the same characters and much of the same spirit as its predecessor, the film rarely feels like it is anything but a sequel. It is the kind of film that reminisces on the events of the previous film - a lot of which is brought on naturally with the characters having not seen one another for 20 years either - and never really takes the time to establish its own memories. It is so caught in the past, it forgets to establish the present, opting instead to spend the whole rehashing old plot points and then just winding up ending the same exact way essentially. It is the kind of sequel that, as it goes along, it just sort of winks at the audience and asks, \""You remember that part of the first movie?\"" While still a largely positive experience, Boyle and his sequel never really live up to the original nor does it ever establish why this was necessary."", ""As with the original, T2 Trainspotting continues to feel like a perfect match between material and director. Focusing on this group of junkies and where they are 20 years later, the film shows some dabbling in drugs and some general re-focusing of their addiction on something positive. Yet, the jump cuts, the \""hip-hop\"" cuts, and constant musical feeling to the film is right up Boyle's alley. His jarring and uncomfortable method of shooting films always leaves his work feeling wholly original and an experience that can only come when watching a Boyle film. After seeing Steve Jobs be largely devoid of Boyle's voice in favor of Aaron Sorkin's, it is a welcome return to \""Boyle the auteur\"" instead of \""Boyle the hired gun\"". While Steve Jobs is a better film, it could have been directed by any number of capable talents. As it stands, T2 Trainspotting is a film that could have only come from Boyle. Jumping from scene-to-scene rapidly, infusing 1970s/1980s rock music, and constantly \""flickering\"" light due to trains passing outside, T2 Trainspotting is a kinetic and frantic film at all turns due to who is sitting in the director's chair."", ""In the course of the film, the greatest achievement by T2 Trainspotting is its portrayal of addiction over time. Obviously, when they were young, they were focused on getting high. Now, in their 40s, these men look back at themselves and wonder why. Some are still addicted to heroin, some do cocaine, another was in jail, and the other is free of drugs. Through deaths of children, impotency, missed chances at fatherhood, and divorce, these four men are still lost and trying to find themselves, having wasted their youth on drugs and still wasting their lives on drugs and crime. Yet, they are not just lost causes or losers who cannot help themselves; they are addicts. As Mark (Ewan McGregor) so astutely puts it, they are all addicts but they need to find something else to be addicted to. For all of them, they continue to be lost and stab one another in the back because they fall into the same habits, refuse to grow up, and continue to get lost in their addiction once they get back into their old way of life."", ""However, while the film can compel in that fashion, it also cannot help but repel and make the audience wonder why they bothered. It is not a bad film as I said. Boyle and the smart commentary on addiction over time more than make it worth a watch, but it is a film that feels more obsessed with showing clips from Trainspotting than actually telling a story. Hell, Spud (Ewen Bremner) even writes a serious of stories about their time 20 years ago that the characters sit around and reminisce about. Boyle cannot help but cut to scenes from the original, highlighting for the audience just how similar everything is and how they go through the same beats. Thematically, it obviously shows how nothing has really changed and these are the same people prone to the same mistakes. In other words, one never heals from addiction, they just find news ways to cope with it. However, cinematically, it rarely works. Instead, the film feels more concerned with reminding audiences of what happened, referencing itself, and then just cutting to the chase and showing clips of the original. It is the kind of self-referential style that comedy sequels often take and are criticized for, yet T2 Trainspotting seems to have gotten off scot-free on this issue. While it does not ruin the film and the overall picture comes out alright in the end, it does make it a sequel that feels too much like a re-hash and re-envisioning of the original instead of a strong and worthy continuation of the stories of its characters."" ]";5
965;kong-skull-island;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Dear Billy,"", ""Kong: Skull Island, directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, is his chance at a Vietnam War. In his sophomore feature, Vogt-Roberts seems to have some self-recognition that he will never get to direct a Vietnam War film. This is not a shot at him, as he is certainly a promising young director with both this and his debut Kings of Summer standing as solid starts that show he is capable of handling both small intimate films and huge films of epic proportions. While neither are particularly great, they are both capable films nonetheless. In this film, he takes his chance to add as much Vietnam imagery as possible by setting the film in 1973 and also tossing in some Cold War paranoia for good measure in this story of a group of people wandering the jungles on a mission, encountering a remote tribe, and facing a being that the tribe sees as a god. Did Francis Ford Coppola not make this film, sans the big monkey, in 1979?"", ""Wearing this Apocalypse Now influence on its sleeve, Vogt-Roberts shows a love of both gratuitous shots of helicopters flying into the island or of the smell of napalm in the morning when Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) tries to dump napalm on Kong. Yet, as with all Kong films, it must run through the beats of the story. Fortunately, Vogt-Roberts improves upon Peter Jackson's recent rendition. By chopping off an hour, the film is not so dreadfully long, which is really a major benefit. Give me the dinosaurs, but not for too long. Give me some backstory, but not extended scenes in a boat and trying to get funding for the trip. This latest edition streamlines it, yet still has the time to get into very compelling mythology regarding Skull Island and the nature of Kong as well as the other beasts that call Skull Island home. Additionally, some of the more unsavory elements of Jackson's films included its depiction of the natives of Skull Island. Depicting them as horrible savages out to kill white people, Jackson's film indulges in nasty stereotypes that create a truly captivating opening scene in that film, but that hardly justifies the racism. With Skull Island, Vogt-Roberts dispatches of this nastiness and instead has a smart and respected tribe in the center of Skull Island. Playing host to WWII veteran Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly) for 28 years, these are no savages and Vogt-Roberts never pretends they are. Instead, the tribe is given its due respect throughout the film. This latest film also ditches the racist undertones of past Kong films. From the original to various remakes, critics have shown the parallel between King Kong being an ape (as black people have often been derogatorily been referred to as \""monkeys\"") and the white/blonde damsel in distress that he clutches in his hand. To critics, it has been a parallel between the perceived assault on the white race by black America. Now, whether or not you buy that or not, I did once have a film professor who claimed that it was why no studio could have an American direct King Kong again, as that parallel had been made. She was not entirely wrong, even if Vogt-Roberts is American as Brie Larson is never a damsel in distress or screeching in his paw, which Naomi Watts did often in 2005. Instead, he holds her once and it is to save her. By then, she had already established that he was not an enemy and was passed out anyways, so no concerns there from her. Of all of its updates, ditching the possible racist undertones is certainly a major plus, regardless of whether you buy into that angle or not."", ""However, Vogt-Roberts' influences also come via the heavily 70s soundtrack, references, and the political situation at the time. Fortunately, it does actually have a lot to do with the plot. As the Cold War is burning brightly and the Americans are coming off a loss in Vietnam, the whole country needs a win. This mission to Skull Island is that win. Finding new species' or a new island would re-establish America as the top dog in the world and, as such, is a major effort even if it takes some convincing. Yet, what the film does very well with its 1970s post-Vietnam setting is to show the men trying to regroup and go back to war, even if it is a different kind of war. The men are resistant and constantly thinking home. From writing letters, discussing home, or making references to what they will do once they get there, the men form a common bond of trying to make the best of the situation. Yet, on the flip side men such as Packard or James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) need this war. Even photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) needs the war, though she is anti-war. The three of them have nothing left to do after the end of the Vietnam War and the Skull Island job represents another opportunity to feel useful in the world at a time when opportunities were scarce."" ]";5

Rejected by Seretse's uncle and current regent of the nation, the British government (both the Labor and Conservative parties), and apartheid-in-progress South Africa (a key British ally and neighbor to Botswana), the marriage is in trouble. Exiled from Botswana and unable to return, Seretse must fight to be able to claim the crown that is rightfully is, return to the people that he loves, and to secure Botswana's future with the prospect of diamond mining occurring on the nation's land."", ""A tale of injustice and racism, Seretse and Ruth fall in love in England and wish to head to Botswana, where Seretse is set to become Chief/King of his people. However, the South Africans - in the process of installing apartheid - do not want it and threaten to stop following British rule if they allow the marriage. A pawn in large political matters of colonialism and rule, A United Kingdom shows that people have always been caught in the crosshairs of politics and those politicians have always lied. Though they recognize allowing them to marry is the right choice, the fear of the South Africans is far too much to let either the Labor or Conservative parties act on his injustice. They even go so far as lying to Seretse and his legal team about the contents of a report into the situation in Botswana, claiming it is on the brink of civil war because Seretse's uncle refuses to accept Ruth and pass the crown onto Seretse. Though Seretse's people and sister accept Ruth whole heartedly, their battle is one that must be fought uphill."", ""In crafting its romance, A United Kingdom is often beautiful. It borders on cliff notes at times with how quickly it goes through it, but it works incredibly well all the same. Romantic, nostalgia, and taboo, director Amma Asante's film captures all of the dirty looks, gestures, and actions they get as a result of their love, while also developing their love. The two go hand-in-hand and it shows that the hatred they face only serves to strengthen their bond together. Unwilling to bend to the wills of the families or the government, the two are defiant, strong-willed, and entirely in love with one another. Listening to other people tell them what to do is hardly an option."", ""However, A United Kingdom is a film far more in line with a political drama. Showing shots in parliament of them debating the issue and the bureaucracy that stops them from being able to be together in Botswana, the film plays out like a political film, not a romantic one. The romance is there and you can tell the connection between them only grows due to the great chemistry between Oyelowo and Pike, but the emphasis here is the politics. Asante uses the film to show how governments do what they know is wrong for political reasons. Though perhaps quite obvious to anybody, A United Kingdom, by first establishing the romance, makes it feel personal and intimate. It is as if the government is not letting us be with our spouse, making the injustice really hit home. How can they deny the love these two people have for one another? How can they bend to the will of a deeply racist country looking? How can they be so greedy, anticipating that diamonds will be found in Botswana? All are obvious, but truly are drilled home perfectly in the film and the end result is a greatly dramatic and oddly thrilling film that wraps you up in the politics of the situation and benefits from it throughout."", ""That said, the star here is David Oyelowo. The climactic moment from the trailer when  he declares he loves his people and land, but also loves his wife is just as rousing and powerful in the film. Oyelowo is an incredibly under-recognized actor, in spite of his stirring turn in Selma as Martin Luther King, Jr. Here, as Seretse Khama, he finds much of the same inspiration and power that he had as King, playing a man who used as a political pawn by entities that had no business dictating affairs in his home country. Oyelowo is a brilliant speaker and delivers his lines with resonance and strength, making him an easy sell as the inspirational political figure. As his wife, Pike is far more reserved, but works on an emotional-level. Showing the hurt in her eyes and face from the suffering her family must go through because of prejudice, Pike may not be nearly as good as Oyelowo here, but she is still very good in her own right."", ""A United Kingdom may not appeal to everyone, as it is largely what would be expected. A powerful tale of injustice, romance, and politics, director Amma Asante does this true story incredible justice in retelling it in this film."" ]";5

A film set in a sanitarium dedicated to providing a \""cure\"" to its wealthy patients, the film was immediately pinned as being a similar film to Shutter Island. With its mansion-setting that holds various secrets, a similar production design, and a protagonist running around reassuring everybody that he is not a patient, it is obvious why many critics and filmgoers drew the comparison. Yet, even if the film does try and hint towards this delusion at times, it is always a distraction for Lockhart (Dane DeHaan). It is not the truth. The audience knows it throughout and he knows it throughout. Instead, this is a film straight out of the late 1990s dressed up to be a psychological thriller set in a place with many dark secrets."", ""Using a horror film setup for its execution, the film is set on top of a hill in a small village in Switzerland. Introducing us to Lockhart, an ambitious and smarmy financial services salesman, the film shows him to be dispatched to the sanitarium to find his company's CEO who has disappeared to the sanitarium right before a big merger. Now, with rumors of the merger being in trouble, the stock price is tanking and the CEO needs to come back and sign off on the merger before there is nothing left to merge. Upon arriving, Lockhart quickly determines that this is a place with secrets. Filled to the brim with rich patients who left their lives of seeming luxury to find a cure to become well, the place is run by Dr. Heinreich Volmer (Jason Isaacs). Held there, along with the patients, is a \""special case\"" named Hannah (Mia Goth). With classic horror film stories of a Baron who used to live in the mansion and similarly sought a cure for his sister/wife's infertility by running experiments on peasant villagers, only for the whole mansion and his sister/wife to be burned by the villagers, the film is immediately eerie and unsettling. Unrolling this information throughout, it becomes all the more apparent that this is still happening today for a very similar purpose."", ""The film draws comparisons to Shutter Island through this setup about a mysterious old mansion and through a line said by Lockhart's mother early on in the film. Handing him a new ballerina she has sculpted, she tells him that this ballerina is special and different from the others she has made. Compared to the others, this one's eyes are closed and is dreaming. This, as we quickly learn, is Hannah. Both are not just described as special, but both wear blue and are in a world where they are not aware of the fact that they are dreaming and deluded. With scenes of awful treatments and mysteries lying around every corner, director Gore Verbinski cultivates a classic asylum-esque feeling to the film that constantly keeps the audience on edge and uncertain as to what lies around the corner. These terrible experiments and the pain endured by Lockhart and others kept hostage in the sanitarium is unspeakable and why the film has earned a reputation for being entirely messed up. Yet, either it is not nearly as messed up as billed or my tastes in film are more messed up than previously imagined."", ""The film further distracts the audience with more parallels to Shutter Island that attempt to distract the viewer from realizing the truth behind the narrative. These distractions include instances where the doctors track down Lockhart and Hannah in the village and convince the similarly medicated police chief that Lockhart is delusional, scenes of \""hallucinations\"" and dreams of eels everywhere, and Lockhart himself coming to believe he is delusional. Yet, the audience constantly knows better. Even when he begins to doubt his own mind, we saw him in the beginning as a regular guy in a financial services company tasked with coming to Switzerland. There should be no delusion here due to this fact, further underscoring how everything at the sanitarium is a massive cover-up, right? Yes and no. The sanitarium is both a terrifying and exploitative scam, but Lockhart is also delusional."", ""This is where the film breaks free and is why it is unfortunate for it to be nothing more than a Shutter Island rehash. Instead, it is far more apt to compare the film to the films of 1999 such as Fight Club, American Beauty, or Office Space. Perhaps, on the surface, this seems an odd comparison, but thematically it is the exact same film. Opening with a scene of a man named Morris working late at night and suffering a heart attack, Verbinski shows us shots of the man's family in a photo on the shelf. With him working late, it is clear that he is largely unable to spend much time with his family. Lockhart's own father, who also worked for the same financial services company that Lockhart now works for, took his own life after being ruined at work. Lockhart, until he goes to Switzerland, is always working. Those who use the sanitarium ran to go get the \""cure\"" after feeling unfulfilled in their lives of work."" ]";5

Yet, under the sure-hand of director Zhang Yimou, this possibly stupid film takes a unique turn into being a stellar realization of old legend (is it really a legend?) that can be mocked for being so clearly untrue, but still contains excellent themes, great action scenes, and a great imagination that always manages to get the film out of problems that could derail other film of the type. Sure, the Chinese may have not built the wall or flown on primitive hot-air balloons, but as a historical science fiction film, The Great Wall is a tight, well-acted, and thoroughly entertaining piece of blockbuster cinema."", ""In many ways, The Great Wall hearkens back to the days of the old-school blockbuster. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, things did not need to be plausible. Kurt Russell could kick ass in any number of science fiction scenarios or a boy could meet an alien or some moron could recreate dinosaurs in a theme park. Yet, nowadays, films with such inventive and imaginative plots as The Great Wall are mocked and chastised for how dumb they sound before they are even released. It is a shame that, as a result, we get more-and-more blockbuster films that just try and show real events - my God, Marvel making us watch United Nations meetings and terrorist bombings when we could just watch Tao Tei monsters eat people instead is a travesty - and, as a result, these films just feel as though they are lacking that extra punch. The extra punch is that of creativity and The Great Wall's unique plot and setting is there to deliver in a mostly successful blockbuster that features the imagination and insanity lacking in today's blockbusters. Though flawed nonetheless with some bad writing, conveniences, and dumb characters, Zhang Yimou finds a way to make blockbuster cinema exciting once more in The Great Wall."", ""He does this by relying upon scope and awe. With shots highlighting the absurd size of the wall to shots of those aforementioned hot-air balloons descending upon the capital of China, the film is obviously gorgeously shot and designed, but is more-so a visual spectacle. Though the film comes in at a very tight 90 minutes, Zhang Yimou infuses a sense of awe and sheer enormity with the film's expansive visuals that are designed to try and communicate the incredible scope and ambition of the film. This is a blockbuster with a sense of style and size that is largely lacking in the more contained and focused blockbusters of today. Here, Yimou constantly reminds the viewer of the vast size of everything involved with audacious battle sequences of the Tao Tei climbing the Great Wall or climbing palace towers. While the former comes in a gorgeously designed action scene where everything is obscured in smoke to increase the fear factor of the moment, both that scene and the latter one in the palace are akin to World War Z's scene of zombies climbing a wall. Similarly to that, the scene is awe-inspiring in its grandiose nature and a visual feast."", ""However, as with any film by Zhang Yimou, this film is hardly just audacious action set pieces. Instead, at its heart, this film can be seen as a wuxia film. Perhaps Yimou's best film, Hero, is a wuxia film and many of the action scenes here show that very same style. As Commander Lin (Jing Tian) battles with some Tao Tei in the capital, she uses her sword in incredible fashions as she literally flies and dances her way through the battlefield. Using William Garin (Matt Damon) as further back-up, Lin is a high-flying spectacle of the highest order throughout this film and is the main connecting thread to Yimou's aforementioned peak as a director. As with Hero, the scenes where he is able to go full wuxia are gorgeously constructed and choreographed with it no longer resembling a battle. Instead, it becomes a dance to the death with one of them wielding a sword used for ballet-esque destruction."", ""Similar to Hero or even classic Japanese cinema such as Akira Kurosawa's Ran, the film's reliance upon color is always purposeful and gorgeous in equal measure. The comparison to Ran is all the more apt due to the fashion in which Yimou utilizes the coloring of the armor worn by the Chinese soldiers to denote key themes or ideas about the person's role in the army. In Ran, Kurosawa took a very similar path with each son wearing a color - blue, red, or yellow - that denoted their defining characteristic. Here, soldiers are assigned either purple, yellow, blue, or red gear. General Shao (Zhang Hanyu) as the leader is assigned black as is Peter Yong (Lu Han). For the former, black is seen as a color of power and, as General, Shao has considerable power. For Peter, black is the color given to young men expected to follow in the path of their ancestors.

969;life-2017;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Life may not re-invent the wheel, but it nonetheless shows that the wheel still has some spin left in its spokes. A film about the discovery of life on another planet, Life is another film that shows the dangers that could await us via these new lifeforms and the lack of knowledge we have regarding them. With its multinational crew trapped inside a spaceship with a single-celled organism named Calvin that quickly becomes a starfish-shaped monster from the depths of hell, Life is a rather typical science fiction horror film about people trapped in their metal casket, awaiting death. Fortunately, through strong direction from Daniel Espinosa, a good cast, and nice design all-around, Life becomes a film that may be cliched and run-of-the-mill, but manages to embody the strongest elements of the genre and miss many of the pitfalls."", ""Slowly building tension and constantly leaving the audience hanging before indulging in its horror movie antics, Life takes over a half hour to actually kill any of the crew. Introducing us to the cast, Calvin, and setting the scene in the lab where Calvin is held, we learn the intricacies of the ship, each members' role on the ship, and follow along as they study Calvin to determine what kind of life they found on Mars. Meanwhile, back on Earth, everybody is elated to find out life exists beyond Earth and eagerly awaits their return. As things begin to head south rapidly on the ship, Espinosa's film had managed to build the tension up tremendously and equally matches it with the proper sense of awe and anticipation. This is the culmination of humanity's constant search for life and, after initially falling in love with what they found, they discover that they should not have tried to find other life. Thus, Life becomes not just an expertly paced and structured horror film, but a great tale of disappointment and heartbreak with the whole crew grappling with both the crushing failure of the mission and the fact that they will all die. As a result, the film is not horrifying in the typical horror film sense - though it absolutely is, which is a credit to Espinosa's patience in the first act and the rising action - but is also horrifying on a truly human level. It is not just that they found an alien that wants to kill them, but it is their own ambition and hunger to find where they came from that is killing them and punishing them for their hubris. It is terrifying to watch play out and Espinosa manages to keep the audience constantly on the edge of their seat."", ""While the character's chaotic and hectic struggle to escape this alien can often get confusing, it never ceases to be compelling. Espinosa smartly drops in shots where the camera seems to be in zero gravity alongside the characters, often resulting in completely upside down shots or ones where the camera just floats freely in the room. Preventing it from ever getting nauseating, this technique is quite immersive and makes it feel as though Calvin is coming right for both you and the characters alike. By trapping the camera and the audience inside the ship with the protagonists, Life manages to be an intensely claustrophobic experience. However, the film manages to be equally as thrilling in non-claustrophobic moments when crew members must fix something outside of the ship or at the very end of the film. While it may be a bit predictable that it is coming, the ending is nonetheless just as chill-inducing as Kevin McCarthy's \""They're coming!\"" warning at the end of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. While nobody yells that the alien is coming or anything, it is an ending that instills the same feeling of dread that made that classic science fiction film really end with a punch. Though Life is not as strong of a film and its ending feels rather obvious - no matter how much Espinosa tried to obscure this fact - it is still an ending that leaves the audience with a sinking feeling in the pit of their stomach."", ""Unfortunately, however, Life is certainly imperfect. Its predictability, no matter how good those predictable pay-offs may be, remains an issue. This predictability is largely derived from just how cliche the film as a whole is with the film never really taking time to try and make the experience unique. Aside from no robot character, the film plays out like a re-hash of Alien right down to the remaining crew members using escape pods to try and get away. While this film brings up \""quarantine\"" and \""protocol\"" more often than Alien, it nonetheless hits many of the same beats and leaves us constantly guessing where the new lifeform may be hiding as we watch along on a heat sensor used by the crew members to see where everybody is at a given time. Yet, in saying that, it is hard to not classify Life as the film that Ridley Scott should be making with his Alien prequel series. It is straight horror, tosses in some ideas about the dangers with finding new life on other planets, and yet never gets too philosophical."" ]";5
970;split;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""From the very first frame of this film, I felt inescapable dread. It became clear that things would only escalate, especially after Split quickly got through the setup in the trailer. With Kevin (James McAvoy) kidnapping the girls practically immediately into the film, Split allows itself to quickly get into the unknown. It got past the setup and now drops three young girls - Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), and Marcia (Jessica Sula) - into the lion's den and leave them no way of escaping. From there, M. Night Shyamalan is free to explore the possibilities of this unknown building and the incredible mind of Kevin, a man trapped inside his own body with 23 distinct personalities. Frequent warnings about \""The Beast\"" only add to the tension and the end result is a film that leaves your stomach churning for nearly two hours."", ""That said, while the thrills and horror are top-notch and akin to films such as The Silence of the Lambs in that is not a film about viscera, but rather an exploration of the mind of a mentally ill man, Split is not explicitly a horror film. It is one that finds horror in the situation of the girls, but instead of focusing on them, the star here is Kevin's mind. The true thrill and insanity of Split is derived from his mind, rather than the situation the girls find themselves in. The latter is often quite derivative and predictable, with obvious implications regarding a gun and Casey learning to hunt proving far too overt to actually become effective. The plot itself is relatively straight forward as these girls simply are trying to get out. Once the film really hones in on Casey and her back story, it becomes equally clear that it will come down to a face-off between her and \""The Beast\"" to escape. Thus, the more straight out thriller/horror elements really do not provide much to chew on. It feels merely superfluous to the real show: Kevin."", ""With 23 personalities trapped inside his mind, Kevin is a man with a lot of walls up. One personality, Dennis, is brutally evil and has OCD. He is also responsible for kidnapping the girls to sacrifice to \""The Beast\"". Others make appearances throughout the film and some are entirely stable, some are diabetic, some are women, and some are even young children. He is a man that is thoroughly fractured and, unfortunately, the bad personalities are gained the \""light\"" and preventing Kevin himself and the more adjusted personalities from being active. It is in this playground of personalities that Shyamalan truly as fun, as he creates great mystery as to who is actually in control of Kevin's body and what they may be capable of doing. While often quite scary, Shyamalan saves it at the end from being a film that demonizes the mentally ill. Upon saying Kevin's real name, Casey gets to interact with the real Kevin. Trapped in September 2014 within his own body, Kevin begs her to kill him before he loses control again. Tragic, heart wrenching, and entirely moving, this sequence shows that while Shyamalan finds fear in the illness suffered by the mentally ill, he does not demonize the mentally ill themselves. Rather, he paints Kevin as a sympathetic figure who desperately needs help and is trapped just like the girls kidnapped by Dennis."", ""The sympathetic portrayal continues in the explanation of Kevin's past. These personalities were created by his mind to help cope with the mental and physical abuse undertaken by Kevin's mother. In one terrifying scene, we get a point of view shot of Kevin hiding under the bed as his screaming and irate mother calls out his full name and closes in with a weapon to harm him. However, just as the calm and docile personalities are byproducts of Kevin's coping, the evil ones - Dennis, Patricia, and \""the beast\"" - are all byproducts as well. Recognizing weakness, the mind has created these darker personalities out of pain. \""The Beast\"", for example, originates from a train because his father left on a train and never returned. As such, all 23 personalities are coping mechanisms and methods by which the mind tries to protect Kevin from further mental strain and hardship. It is via this reveal that Split takes on a very depressing tone as though we see the damage he can cause when \""fully evolved\"", it comes from a place of pain and agony. Though he must be stopped, it is hard not to shed a tear over the agony he still endures while trapped inside his own body and buried beneath coping mechanisms."", ""However, this portrayal does explain his approach to the girls. Claire and Marcia are the true targets. Having stalked them for weeks, he had decided upon them because they were impure and perfect for the Beast to consume. They were impure because they had never suffered pain. In his messed up post-traumatic state, Kevin's personalities have reasoned that to reach purity, one must suffer. Thus, he does not kill Casey since she bears the scars of either self-harm or her Uncle raping her to this very day."" ]";5
971;the-founder;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A mesmerizing horror film, The Founder is the clearest depiction of modern day America ever put to film. While a clunky work, director John Lee Hancock's depiction of Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) swooping in, stealing McDonald's from its rightful owners, passing it off as his own, screwing those brothers over, and then really sticking it to them to squash them entirely, The Founder plays out like a modern day depiction of capitalism. With the little guy getting screwed over in the name of corporate's bottom line, America has been plagued with this rapidly decreasing middle class while the rich only get richer. In this film, Hancock puts this on full display in a terrifying depiction of smart business practices at the expense of human kindness and empathy. Instead, it is win at all costs and allow the losers to bathe in a tub of their own blood."", ""In an excellent performance, Keaton plays the hard working and hard-nosed shark that was Ray Kroc brilliantly. He is a dreamer who will stop at nothing to have everything he could ever hope to think about. From creating a multi-billion dollar corporation out of merely seeing the name \""McDonald's\"" to leaving his wife after one glance of a new woman who captures his eye, nothing happens quickly for Kroc but it always happens. No matter what he does, he is always thinking twenty steps ahead and is clearly a brilliant businessman. While many of his ideas are handed to him, he builds them up and is able to capitalize on the ideas given to him. Sometimes, in life, it is not originality that reaps rewards. Rather, it is being willing and able to execute an idea, whether it is yours or not. Here, Kroc does exactly that and takes every idea over the goal line with brilliant precision and persistence. Unfortunately, in doing so, he tramples over everybody who gets in his way or he perceives as getting in his way even if they are just innocent bystanders."", ""It is this negativity that creates the central conflict of The Founder. Ray Kroc may be a brilliant businessman, but he is a horrible husband and person to be in business with. He is cut throat and not afraid to let his eyes wander to new possibilities. Dick McDonald (Nick Offerman) realizes this quickly, but sticks with the deal because of the urging of Mac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch). Unfortunately, Kroc is a carnivore. He feeds on fresh meat and seeks to sink his teeth into whatever competition he can find. Turning on everybody in his life throughout the course of the film, The Founder is greatly negative towards its subject and is unafraid to extensively highlight the flaws in his character. No matter how smart he was and how much of a visionary he could be, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Ray Kroc was a mostly bad man who was unnecessarily cruel to everybody who did him wrong in his eyes."", ""The part that does hold back The Founder, however, is a problem inherent in many biopics. Director John Lee Hancock is simply unable to blend his subject's professional life with his personal life. While showing many of the same traits in his personal life, especially with how he just dumps Ethel (Laura Dern) for a new wife when she offers him more in that moment, the film always seems to come to a halt. Compared to personal indulgences in films such as There Will Be Blood or The Social Network, both cited as influences on the work, The Founder is never able to make it gel. Thematically, they work, but for the film's pacing and plot it always feels like stomping on the breaks in favor of taking an undesirable detour. There is no flow or cohesion as a result of these scenes that just distract from the story of McDonald's being stolen from the brothers. Instead, it turns into too much backstory about Ray Kroc and not enough about the film's true victims. The scenes, especially Dern's Ethel, feel like filler and Hancock just checking off a box from the biopic formula checklist, instead of being a section of the film he is interested in at all. Had he been interested in exploring Ethel and Kroc's personal life, their divorce would have been more important and he would not have just jumped to him having married Joan (Linda Cardellini), who was actually his third wife, not his second. The film never actually embraces exploring Kroc's at home life to the point, which is a shame since it is in the film. Featuring an excellent performance from Michael Keaton in the central role, The Founder may not be 2016's The Social Network, but it is a terrifying exploration of the death of the middle class and rise to power of individuals with questionable morals. It indulges into Ray Kroc's personal life far too much to be sure, but its unflinching damnation of its central character and lack of fear in showing his negative qualities, makes the film a rarity in the biopic genre. A chilling, entertaining, compelling, and entirely revealing look behind the true story behind McDonald's, John Lee Hancock's The Founder is a very strong work."" ]";5
972;paterson;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A slice of life film, Paterson depicts one week (Monday to Sunday) in the life of Paterson (Adam Driver) who lives in Paterson, New Jersey with his girlfriend Laura (Golshifteh Farahani), his dog Marvin, works as a bus driver for the city, and goes to a bar run by Doc (Barry Shabaka Henley). Aside from the weekend, his days are relatively the same. He wakes up, gets breakfast, goes to work, has a conversation with a fellow employee who's life is in shambles, he drives, he goes home, he has dinner, he walks Marvin, he goes to the bar, and then repeat. Yet, much like life, things change every time. To the untrained eye, particularly when it is your own eye, life barely changes from day-to-day. Capturing this beauty and showing how it changes, Paterson is a simple and down-to-earth film that plays like a poem about life and all of its odd idiosyncrasies."", ""Paterson is, above all, a film about people. That is the biggest change from the day-to-day. Every morning, Paterson wakes up next to Laura. Every morning, their sleeping position is different. Every morning, he eats breakfast. Every morning, he is eating something different, sitting somewhere new, or the dog is somewhere new. Every morning, he goes to work. Every day, he encounters new people, new sights in the city, new conversations, and new incidents. Every day, he goes home. Every day, Laura made something new for dinner, painted something, or purchased something new. Every day, he walks to the bar with Melvin. Every day, he sees somebody new or has a conversation with a stranger. Every day, he goes to the bar. Every day, he sees new people who are new or familiar faces to him and the conversations or situations are different. Though, on the surface, Paterson is a film about seven days that just repeat themselves like Groundhog Day, each day is vibrantly different. It is a film that celebrates the mundane nature of life, but also the subtle changes that make each day feel new. It is not merely a world defined by the fact that the sun rises every morning and sets every evening. The times of the sunrise and sunset even change each day, symbolic of the slight and practically unnoticeable change of each day. We have our routines, especially Melvin, but things will not always go to plan and things will often change from the day-to-day. Jarmusch's picture is tribute to that and a simple and structurally unique poem to that simplicity."", ""Beautifully acted by Adam Driver, the role is incredibly reserved as he plays the quite and meditative Paterson. Constantly writing in his secret notebook of poems, he writes about simple things like a box of matches. He finds the poetry in life and pens poems based upon that simple beauty. Largely not emotive, he is a man that simply goes through life and likes what he likes and what he likes most is poetry. Yet, his reserved nature even applies to his love. He does not read his poems to his girlfriend, he does identify himself as an aspiring poet to people he meets, and he does not want to share his poems with the world. Writing the poems is enough for him, nothing more and nothing less. He is content with his life in Paterson, driving a bus, living with his girlfriend, and going to the bar. His poetry, as it stands, is all he wants it to be. Every inch of his life, even his girlfriend and her obsession with black-and-white, is what he wants it to be. His aspirations are to wake up as himself the next day and to do what he likes, even if it does not conform with the aspirations and dreams of society."", ""Yet, what sets Paterson apart is its complete lack of cinematic aspirations. In many ways, Jarmusch's film is like Paterson himself. As Laura pushes him to release his poems, he half-heartedly promises to make copies of the poems. Whenever the audience thinks the film is setting up something via foreshadowing or about to reach a scene of unspeakable tension, the film refuses. With a street tough warning Paterson about how Melvin might get dog jacked, Paterson talking to an aspiring rapper who seems oddly intrigued by the dog, Everett (William Jackson Harper) bringing a gun to the bar, and Paterson's bus breaking down, it feels like the film is constantly foreshadowing or introducing palpable drama. The most common fear is regarding the dog and that fear could be felt in the theater. Left outside the bar as Paterson drinks and pals around, we are constantly left with the belief that Melvin will be stolen. But, inevitably, the screen fades to black and he begins the next day next to Laura in bed. There is even a scene where the door is open and Melvin runs out, but it is shown to be merely part of his routine as he immediately scampers back in. Jarmusch even openly mocks his audience in regards to the bus incident. With it breaking down due to an electical problem, passengers immediately ask if it will blow up. The film seems to play into this by having Paterson tell everybody to stay a good distance away from the bus."" ]";5

Yet, this one feels decidedly less assured. Embracing formalistic indulgences along the way that clash with the realistic and natural tone of the film, the film lacks cohesion at times and feels overly ambitious for its story. Fortunately, there is so much to enjoy about this film. From the style and general aesthetic feeling given by the film, as well as great characters and acting, 20th Century Women is an often moving and funny film about Mills' childhood surrounded by women in Santa Barbara. In many ways, it is a film about how people do not understand one another, in spite of all of our efforts to figure out what makes those around us, and ourselves, tick. In this endeavor, 20th Century Women is incredibly successful and finds a lot of resonance. Unfortunately, unnecessary style distracts from the film and feels more indulgent than anything."", ""These stylistic indulgences include montages of old pictures of historical events, the rainbow streaks following the cars as they drive on the highway, and giving the future of the characters after 1979. Of these, the rainbow streaks seems to be the one that I have the most trouble with. It helps to create the drug induced, dream-like atmosphere of Santa Barbara, yes. Santa Barbara and 1979 are very much characters in this film themselves with the city coming to represent the loose, free thinking nature of the characters, and being just as influenced by drugs as they are. 1979 comes into play with the time, Jimmy Carter's speeches, and how it is a point of change and a turning point in their respective lives for a variety of reasons as shown in the film. Yet, the rainbow streaks feel indulgent. The film's character are supposed to reflect real people and its situations are somewhat real occurrences. Yet, the style hints at Mills indulging too much in artist tendencies. The out of place montages of old pictures that do not have much to do with the plot suffer from the same indulgence. It feels wholly misplaced in a film of this type and is not something I remember Beginners suffering from. If memory serves, that was a very grounded film, set in the real world and rarely diverting from that world. Instead, Mills attempts to create the same psychedelic and 1970s trip created in films such as Inherent Vice or The Nice Guys. The film is stepped with nostalgia and these glory days of 1979, but the film suffers from this style. The trippy atmosphere is interesting, but is ill-fitting for a story of this ilk. In the aforementioned films, it works because the films are clearly going for a certain aesthetic and very formalistic in its story. But, Mills' story here is very real, authentic, and raw. These nostalgic indulgences for a film as real as Manchester by the Sea feel more like something out of La La Land, which leaves it feeling incredibly jumbled in regards to its style and intent."", ""The film also suffers from its dialogue. Once more, it attempts to create great characters and it succeeds. The writing is glorious when it comes to these characters, but the dialogue lacks the punch of realism. It feels written and, again, feels ill-fitted for a story of this nature. Honestly, I may need a rewatch of this, but conversations often fall awkwardly flat. Such as:"", ""\""I like the way your hair smells.\"""", ""\""I make my own shampoo.\"""", ""\""Of course you do.\"""", ""This dialogue feels more like Wes Anderson dialogue in a very formalistic setting. Instead, Mills tries to strike a balance between the two styles, but these lines just feel too quirky and purposefully odd to really resonate. Much of this film is like this and some of the dialogue does work quite well comedically, but feels as though it contributes to the tonal awkwardness of the film. Is it a realistic with real worlds, as the premise, characters, and situations would have you believe? It would also be in line with being semi-autobiographical. Or, is it an aesthetic filled joy ride through Santa Barbara's free thinking community with quirky dialogue? It is here where I struggle to rationalize why I still like 20th Century Women, even in spite of this tonal awkwardness."", ""The brilliance of 20th Century Women may reveal itself to me upon rewatches, but for now, it largely lies within its themes. Early in the film, Dorothea (Annette Bening) asks her son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann) to be there for Abbie (Greta Gerwig). Abbie rents a room from Dorothea and lives upstairs, but had been diagnosed with cervical cancer in the year prior and was going to see if the surgery had removed the cancer or not. Dorothea, knowing she would not be able to be there, wants Jamie to offer Abbie emotional support, regardless of whether the news is good or bad. In asking, she comments on how \""men always want to fix problems for women\"", in order to steer him away from his male tendency to \""fix things\""."" ]";5
974;get-out;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Think about color. I do not mean race, just color. White, throughout cinema and life as a whole, has taken on a holy connotation. People are safe when they are in the light. Horror movies find their greatest tension at night, not the day. Things do not go bump in the broad daylight. The light shows the truth, whereas darkness hides it and obscures it turning it into the unknown. White is safety. White lights envelope characters in a hidden suit of armor. On the other side of things, black has come to be seen as death and has a far more sinister connotation. The grim reaper wears black, witches wear black, the term black magic, and the darkness itself is black. Black is, more often than not, evil. But, it is through horror movies that these preconceived notions have always been challenged. In the tremendous horror film Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is at her greatest danger in the light. Hitchcock, knowing that people equate white with safety, dumps his protagonist in a bright, white-lit bathroom where she quickly succumbs to the violence of Norman Bates. While horror films today still rely upon people's thoughts regarding white and black, Psycho and many other films saw an opportunity to subvert expectations and show audiences that the daylight is hardly the armor they once perceived it to be. George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead took it even a step further and it is that film that serves as the greatest influence of Jordan Peele's Get Out."", ""In that film, Ben (Duane Jones) is the only black character and he is also the protagonist. Alongside him are exclusively white zombies and the catatonic white girl Barbra. These portrayals served as the basis for Richard Dyer's brilliant series of essays entitled, White. In these pieces, Dyer argued that white and black came to mean something entirely different in Romero's film. While beforehand, white had always meant pure and holy, whereas black was the exact opposite, Night of the Living Dead changed the talking points. In the film, white came to mean death. It represented order and rigidity. White was lifelessness and, as a result, white people had become zombies. Meanwhile, black was the presence of life. No longer was black the absence of color (life), it was instead the very embodiment of it with it standing it contrast to the zombie-like portrayal of whites. That said, Dyer also asserts that we can only see this dichotomy when whites and blacks are portrayed together. In films with exclusively white casts, such as Sam Mendes' American Beauty, audiences are blind to the whiteness of the characters. The whiteness is simply who they are and audiences miss just how much the characters in films such as that resemble the same lifelessness and rigidity of the zombies in Night of the Living Dead. However, by presenting whites and blacks in contrast to one another, Get Out is able to explore the relationship between the two colors in an entirely racial context."", ""As is readily apparent in the film, the whites are zombies. They are hypnotized and robotic, they are the pure embodiment of order and rigidity. When Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is in their presence, they all uniformly look at him and stare him down. Their manner of speech is very structured, their commentary predictable (I knew INSERT BLACK ATHLETE or the Obama comments), and their seemingly positive reception towards Chris feels pre-coded. Everything is artificial in this environment and while the film shows it in a humorous light, the lifelessness of this gathering of people is astounding. When the Armitage family throws their yearly party, which is on the same day every year, the entirety of the guests pull up at the same exact time. When they play bingo, everybody wins. While these people may not be zombies, they certainly act like mindless zombies who simply go through the motions of living and are merely watching themselves life."", ""This, of course, is why the Armitages and other white families utilize blacks. Kidnapping them or roping them in via Rose (Alison Williams), the people of this suburb use black people as vessels for life. Whether it is to live again, to see, or any number of reasons, the whites in the film recognize that the blacks have something they do not: life. Chris is the very embodiment of life. He is energetic and, though cautious about meeting her parents, in love with Rose. He is living life to the fullest at this point in his life and looking positively towards the future. Even better, he is black. Per Dyer, black represents life and this is very much the case in Get Out. His friend Rod (Lil Rey Howery) is boisterous and loud, spitting out comical lines at the speed of light. Compared to every white character in the film, this duo of black characters are full of energy. Every white character, aside from when they put up a facade to trick blacks, just float by."" ]";5

Dishing out headshots like Oprah Winfrey gives away cars, John Wick: Chapter 2 finds the famed Boogeyman fighting for his life once again. After losing his wife, dog, and car, in the first film, Wick loses his freedom this time around via Italian crime boss Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scarmacio). Cashing in a marker given to him by John that let Wick get out of the game the first time around, Santino thrusts him back into the world of assassin work by tasking him to kill Santino's sister, Gianna (Claudia Gerini). Unraveling from there, the world comes crashing down around Wick with Gianna's bodyguards, fellow assassins, and then the entire world all coming down on him by the film's end."", ""As with the original, John Wick: Chapter 2 has absolutely exquisite action sequences. With a seamless flow and orchestral feeling to the action, the film is a sight for sore eyes. While its love of headshots leaves the film blood soaked, the fight sequences always take center stage. It is like watching a ballet with two equal foes entering in a dance with one another that only one will survive. Former stuntman turned director Chad Stahelski continues to show what makes this franchise so appealing: its gorgeous stunts and fight choreography. For those who do not believe that action can be beautiful and put together in such a fine-tuned and structured fashion that it becomes like a dance with guns and knives, John Wick continues to stand as the perfect counter to that claim. Yet, its choreography is not all that makes the film's action appealing. Utilizing great set pieces - such as the Reflections on Self exhibit in the museum that plays out like a hall of mirrors - there is always some new secret or foe hiding around every corner. They are nuanced, extravagant, and detailed sets that allow Stahelski and his star, Keanu Reeves, to really feel their way around the dance floor and find out what spot on the set is the perfect one for each move. Alongside this, Stahelski's refusal to turn the film into a handheld camera mess continuously rewards the viewer with steady, heavily digital, and incredibly crisp action scenes. The camera certainly moves, to be clear, but it is never jarring. Instead, it is in rhythm with Wick and the action with no frivolous cuts that could disorient or distract from what is taking place. Instead, the fight is given room to breathe and it takes incredibly deep breaths."", ""Matching the gorgeous visuals of the fight sequences is the color scheme of the film. With its neon backlighting in every sequence, it is hard to deny that John Wick is a truly stylish film. Tossing in a gorgeous usage of blue blended with any number of warm colors, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a truly beautiful film. With the crispness of digital photography matching perfectly with the film's neon aesthetic, the composition of shots and blending of colors in the background make this a film that is littered with eye candy. Together with those aforementioned fight scenes and the film is one with visuals that far exceed the quality of its plot and acting. Whenever the story may slack or a line comes off awkwardly, the film's impeccable use of color always picks it up off of the ground. The framing and composition are similarly top-notch, particularly in the sequence with Gianna. As she lies naked in a tub with the blood from her wrists taking over the water, the camera rises to the ceiling and looks down upon her. In a candle-lit bathroom with blue water and deep red blood all over, Gianna lays with her hands outstretched. It is a powerful scene before this, but with this final image of the bloody but silent carnage left by a visit from John Wick, it really cements itself as a highlight of the film."", ""Unfortunately, too much of the film is obsessed with reminiscing on the original. While the references to the original are quite limited, the film nonetheless keeps the same plot idea: people are stupid to mess with John Wick. Wherever he goes, his name is met with horror and fear. It is obvious why this is the case, but this was the same situation in the original. Though it is nice to stay consistent to some degree, it would be nice to see the franchise mix it up instead of constantly reminding us he is deadly. In the first film, we needed to know this information. Now, however, it feels purely masturbatory with regard to how great of an assassin Wick is. Going through a plot where literally every person in the world becomes an assassin or knows who Wick is without being told, it does become rather implausible for one, but also feels a bit like a satire."" ]";5
976;a-monster-calls;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Guillermo del Toro's protege, Juan Antonio Bayona, continues to deliver high-quality emotional gut punches with his latest work, A Monster Calls. An unfortunate box office failure earlier this year, the film is a heart wrenching tale of a boy named Conor (Lewis MacDougall) whose mother Lizzie (Felicity Jones) is dying of cancer. With a hard-nosed grandmother Mrs. Chandler (Sigourney Weaver) accompanying them and providing Conor with what will be his new home, a neglectful father who lives in a different country (Toby Kebbell), and bullies at school making his life hell, Conor is visited by a monster (Liam Neeson). Arriving to teach him three lessons in life and to elicit Conor's darkest secret from him, A Monster Calls is a film about a young boy learning to cope with the loss of his mother, his own anger for how he is behaving, and how he desperately tries to grab control of something around him. Unfortunately, with everyone else collapsing all around him, there are practically no alleys to turn down but the one opened by the monster. Moving, heart-wrenching, and an absolute tearjerker, A Monster Calls is yet another score for Bayona's brand of emotional cinema set against fantastical backgrounds (The Orphanage)."", ""While the film's depiction of a mother dying from cancer and how it impacts everyone around her is undoubtedly manipulative, Bayona picks at the viewer's heart strings so effectively and with such authentic emotion, that we hardly ever notice his hand. Gracefully put together and nimbly jumping between its hard-hitting themes about loss, grieving, and overcoming the death of a loved one, with its more adventurous and creative look at coping with a fairy tale watercolor backdrop, A Monster Calls is an excellently written and directed film that really finds a way to keep its eye on the prize. No matter what happens in the film, this is a film about a boy facing the toughest thing he has ever faced. His denial that it is happening. His rage about it happening. And finally, his acceptance that it is happening and looking ahead to how to heal and grow from the experience."", ""Visiting with the monster everyday at 12:07 AM, Conor must face the deepest secret he has within him and one that is all too relatable: he wants it to be over. The agony. The waiting. The pain. The anger. The suffering. The anticipation. Yes, for it to be over means that his mother Lizzie must die, but he wants it to be over. In the end, we all know this feeling. It is, honestly, one of the tougher elements of coping with the loss of a loved one, because it is tinged with regret. A Monster Calls demonstrates this perfectly with how this anger and guilt felt by Conor over how he wants this stage of his life to end manifests itself in his everyday life. From hating his grandmother and destroying her house, to rejecting his father out of anger, and to beating up his bully and sending him to the hospital, Conor copes with rage. Yet, though the expression it outwardly, it is focused entirely on himself. He loves his mother. The two have been best friends for as long as he can remember. She cuddles with him watching movies and when he is scared at night. She taught him to paint. The two are inseparable, but she must go now and he cannot accept that he wants her to go just for him to stop feeling the pain of waiting for her to go. It is a conflicting feeling and one that can destroy even the strongest of adults, let alone a teenager."", ""Yet, he must learn to not just overcome the impending death of his mother, but his own anger at himself. Through the stories, he learns that people are not all good or all bad, that believing something can happen is the first step to it actually happening, and that crying out for help is a sign of strength and one that will get him noticed, but to be noticed is not everything; one must be able to recognize their own pain themselves as well before it gets out of hand. It is alright to be mad and to let yourself be heard, but you cannot let it consume your entire being. Even worse, you cannot let that anger be focused inward to the point that you write yourself off as a bad person, as young Conor had done to himself for his own secrets. Each human being has two sides to them and can simultaneously be good and evil. This applies to not just Conor in the film, but also to his grandmother and father. For the former, she is losing her daughter to cancer. She has already lost her husband - with the established fact that Lizzie coped in the exact same way as Conor - and is struggling to find a way to accept that she will lose her daughter too. She takes out her anger in various ways and does boss Conor around, but she loves him and her entirely. His father loves him as well, even if things are not perfect. Yes, he re-married and has a new daughter, but he still loves Lizzie and Conor. It is just that things could not work between them and now his job has him in Los Angeles."" ]";5
977;silence;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""My mother more than anybody else is the reason I am a Christian today. She raised me a Christian, but never forced my hand. When I was young, she asked whether I wanted to accept Jesus in my heart or not. In high school, she told me she would love me no matter what and did not want to force me to believe in Christ. Above all, she taught me that a relationship with God is a personal endeavor. It is not one to embark on through another person. Instead, reading the Bible, speaking to God, and praying for guidance from Him is the path to fulfillment. You must find God for yourself and it likely not the same way God is viewed by others. As such, I have never gone to Church, nor will I likely ever find myself listening to somebody preach about God. Instead, I pray daily. I try to live up to his values, but I fail every single day. I sin and ask for forgiveness. Ashamedly, I am often like Kichijiro (Y?suke Kubozuka) in this very film. Constantly asking for forgiveness only to commit the same sin once more is a great vice and struggle of my own. To see it portrayed in this film is riveting and heart wrenching. Yet, Silence's pre-eminent impact upon me is two-fold. One, what I have discussed. The personal relationship with God that one must form in order to truly know Him. Two, the doubt that comes with following the path of righteousness. If I have not doubted my faith everyday that I have truly known God, then I must have not been awake long enough on the missed days to grapple with my faith."", ""A harrowing portrayal of God's supposed silence, but solemn stolidness alongside us through our trials and tribulations, Silence is set during the mid-1600s. Depicting the horrifying torture and persecution of Christians in Japan, Silence stars Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver as two priests, Father Rodrigues and Father Garupe, tasked with finding Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). Allegedly a fallen priest, Father Ferreira had gone missing and fallen victim to the wrath of the inquisitor. Father Rodrigues and Father Garupe have faith, however, that he has not left the faith. Upon arrival in Japan, they find a horrible picture. Torture, pain, and hidden Christians who are persecuted and threatened with death. This leads to some graphic moments, but the film is not overly violent. Instead, it gives a face to the sound of the tormented who were forced to suffer as Christ once did."", ""That said, Father Rodrigues - after suffering for a long time - has an encounter with Father Ferreira. It is once Father Ferreira is brought into the fold that Martin Scorsese's incredibly personal film soars. With Father Ferreira, Father Rodrigues learns why they are being persecuted and why they have failed to lead the Japanese to Christ. Above all, he learns that beliefs speak louder than actions or words. As such, we see Father Ferreira explain that the language and cultural barrier is too great for somebody uninitiated in the culture to teach the Bible. Though those being killed are dying for what they believe is Christ, they are instead dying because Rodrigues (and Ferreira before him) had told them to die. It is only through the apparent and repeated renouncement of God that their suffering will stop and, as such, it is a necessity. However, they learn to live in hiding. By day, they identify Christian items for the inquisitor. Yet, all throughout the day, they speak to God and foster their relationship with Him. Though they renounce Him to the Japanese when they ask, it is done to further the word of God throughout the country. By hiding and denying Him verbally but not in their hearts, it is not an act of self-preservation, but a way of letting Christianity survive in Japan. As Father Rodrigues says at one point, to say that he is dead, it would mean that Christianity in Japan is dead. Without Father Rodrigues and the other fallen priests retaining the faith within them and not causing their people to suffer, they gain strength and are able to do their work as missionaries. Those who seek the fallen priests and wish to learn the way of God are rewarded with a man that is able to speak to them about God. Though the film does not depict these moments, the final shot of Father Rodrigues still holding the cross after he is dead certainly shows that the man died a man of faith and, as his scene with Kichijiro highlighted, he was still willing to shine a light for others."", ""One of the most important moments of Silence, however, is when Father Rodrigues steps on the image of God. In the Bible, God rebukes those who worship idols and practice idolatry. This image is an idol. It is not God. God Himself tells Father Rodrigues this when we hear God speak for the first time in this film. He encourages him to step on the image and to save the suffering followers. Father Rodrigues does so and the Japanese Christians suffering in the pit and tied upside down and spared. For the rest of his life, he finds other idols and reports them to the Japanese."" ]";5
978;guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The sequel to the only Marvel film that I have loved was a prospect that I was very much looking forward to back in 2014. However, since then, Marvel films have gotten progressively more and more generic with the marks from the assembly line obstructing every image of the film. Last year's Captain America: Civil War was the first sign of trouble at Marvel studio with a made-by-committee checklist type of film that just fell flat. Doctor Strange, however, took it a step further and was a film made by both committee and focus group. The results were absolutely alarming. As such, there was no way I was rushing out to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Part of it was fear that the Guardians would be ruined as well, but a lot of it was low expectations as demanded by being so underwhelmed by Marvel and the superhero genre as a whole in 2016. It seemed as though superhero movies were no longer something I could enjoy like everybody else with jokes I did not find funny and plots that were hardly worth my time. Fortunately, Guardians Vol. 2 somewhat changed that."", ""I say somewhat because this film is still littered with issues. The original was defined by its raw and unexpected parent-driven emotion, its sense of family, constant jokes, interesting worlds and planets, music from the 80s, and more. This film has all of that, but slightly worse. It lacks the originality and inspiration found in the original on these fronts, even while possessing the most inspiration and daring found in the Marvel Cinematic Universe right now. This film tosses in neon (akin to Drive or other neon-lit favorites) and barren landscapes (akin to Mad Max: Fury Road) to the mix after the moviegoer surveys received by Marvel advised them to include both due to how \""in\"" both were at the moment. Blended with the rehashing and fan service from the original, the film certainly feels like a film that was made to be pleasing, but not challenging or unique. It is a conveyor belt film like Marvel's other recent output, but it is by way of director James Gunn. With a light hearted energy where the film knows how stupid it all is, the film somehow sticks the landing and is like a slightly shinier and more precisely put together piece from that very same conveyor belt."", ""Yet, though it sticks the landing, the film's writing does still often leave a lot to be desired. One of the most egregious missteps comes in the very beginning. Dropping us into a situation where the Guardians face off with some monster to protect batteries at the behest of a race of people known as the Sovereign people, the film then introduces us to the high priestess of those people, Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki). With her first words being forced exposition about who the Sovereign people are even though the Guardians should already know that, the film not just tips its hand that these people will keep popping up, but it is a line of dialogue that adds nothing to the story and never comes into play in any meaningful way. They hired the Guardians to defend this battery and then encounter them throughout the film. Leave it at that. There is no defined need to explain who they are because it is nothing but unneeded exposition and in-your-face foreshadowing."", ""The film's in-your-face foreshadow is only foreshadowed by this awful moment of exposition, however. Once introduced to Peter's (Chris Pratt) father, Ego (Kurt Russell), we are bombarded by Gamora (Zoe Saldana) immediately warning Peter that he may not be all good. After wanting him to find his father, she immediately jumps past the honeymoon period and alerts the audience that there is more to Ego than may immediately meet the eye. Through not-so-subtle repeated mentions of secrets held by Ego and some mystery regarding whether or not he is everything he claims to be, the film continuously hints at a big twist and reveal that is forthcoming. By the time it arrives, Gunn plays it as if it were a twist even if it had been spelled out and fully outlined by the time it is finally revealed. Instead of a shock, it becomes a situation where the audience just waits for Peter and the Guardians to finally wake up and realize that Ego is not good. Though the reveal is quite nice with the mountain of bodies, the film's shock and surprise reveal about who the true antagonist is about as secretive and subtle as James Gunn coming out and saying that Ego is bad at the very beginning of the movie. Naming him Ego is also a major clue here, particularly with his cliche demands of the world."", ""This cliched demand to destroy the world and make it in his own image is one of the film's many cliches that really do hold it back, as is often the case with superhero films, particularly Marvel ones. Though handed a compelling villain, the film largely does not take advantage of him and instead just turns him into another \""destroy the world\"" villain, which is a shame. As is often the case, the film also has a \""love conquers all\"" message that kills him."" ]";5
979;jackie;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Nobody will ever understand Jackie Kennedy and the pain she went through after the death of her husband. While we all have lost loved ones, few have lost a spouse. Even fewer have lost that spouse while the First Lady of the United States and none of those women were alive to be there for Jackie. She was isolated and all alone. Nobody could comprehend her grief and nobody, thankfully, can today. Sitting next to her husband driving through a parade, he is shot and his mangled head rests on her lap and she sits there with his blood splashing on her body. In this eternally lasting image, few have sat down to truly examine what that day and the succeeding few days were in the mind of Jackie Kennedy. However, in director Pablo Larrain's intimate look at her mind and grief in those days, he finds beauty, pain, and agony. But, above all, he finds a woman with so much strength, so much grace, and so much power, it is chill inducing. Punctuated by a powerful and articulate performance by Natalie Portman, the film leaves you in emotional ruins repeatedly and is an entirely beautiful, moving, and stirring portrayal of the strongest and hardest week of Jackie Kennedy's life."", ""Upon its release, Jackie gained notoriety for its unique structure. It is not a biopic at all. Shot with grainy documentary style footage, the film is an inside look at both Jackie's life after her husband's death and the descent into madness experienced by the country afterwards. However, that is not what makes it unique. Rather, the film is lyrical and poetic. Its dialogue is overwrought, begging to be quoted. It feels too prim. Too precise. Too detached from reality. Yet, that is entirely the point. This is no biopic about Jackie Kennedy. It is an album composed of \""songs\"" about her life and key defining moments: the death of her husband, the televised tour of the White House, planning for the funeral, and talking to a priest. Complemented by interludes courtesy of an the famed interview with Life Magazine, the film takes on a poetic approach to telling its story and this is incredibly irregular for the genre. As a regular of the poetry of the storytelling, it is nonlinear and it  shows scenes from those aforementioned moments before and after the assassination in varied order."", ""This structure truly lends itself to the way in which the film is quotable, but overwrought. Its dialogue is aching to be recognized as powerful. As timeless. As stirring. Yet, it is all of those things. He may feel a tad forced in this regard, but it works. Matching the hypnotic, dream-like, and thoroughly lyrical nature of the storytelling, the dialogue feels mystical, other worldy, and unattainable. Jackie's words are so well chosen, as are those of her counterparts. In this, the dialogue catches the class, the grace, and the power with which women in her position are expected to act and speak. Her words are well chosen for fear of portraying herself and her husband negatively. In her interview with the journalist (Billy Crudup), she unleashes at times and becomes less formal, but never allows him to print these words. In these moments, she becomes wordier. With those she acts entirely formal around, her words are limited and more carefully selected. While I say the film is overwrought, it is not to detract from the film. Rather, it is perfectly elaborate in its limited words and prim/proper dialogue. Each word and each line feels quotable and verbose."", ""This verbosity is certainly what led the Kennedy's and others in power to seem unattainable. In particular, their life was a fairy tale. It was spectacular, overwhelming, and extravagant. Their wealth was obscene and otherworldly. It embodied regality and the belief that this was the royal family of the United States, if there ever were to be one. Larrain, a Chilean-born filmmaker, has managed to eloquently and brilliantly captures this cult of personality surrounding the Kennedy family and captures it so well, in fact, that the film has been criticized for the same reasons Jackie was criticized in her life. It is too cold. Too distant. Too reserved. Yet, it is for these elements that the film is so brilliant. Not only is it poetic and gorgeously crafted narratively, but its feeling and emotions as a film keep the audience at a distance. It never hopes to understand Jackie and her mindset after her husband's death, as that is an impossible enterprise to undertake. It is simply something that could never be accomplished. As such, instead, Larrain's film reduces intimacy. He uses grainy documentary style footage, old school television footage, and has a cold and carefully orchestrated Portman in the lead role. She embodies Jackie Kennedy to the very last detail both in her manner of speaking, walking, and body language. It is a film that is cold and dead behind the eyes, shutting out the world from every hoping to understand the pain its main character underwent and preventing us from fully grasping who she was."" ]";5
980;alien-covenant;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""One of the most divisive films in recent memory has to be Ridley Scott's Prometheus. Depicting a manned mission to space to find where we came from, the film marked Scott's return to the Alien franchise and was a wildly imaginative and gorgeously designed science fiction film. It unlocked secrets in a magical world of mystery, all while delivering the roots of the xenomorphs that have come to define the franchise. However, its dumb character actions have led many to write it off as trash. Obviously, I disagree, but the complaint is fair. Alien: Covenant marks yet another divisive return to the beloved franchise for Scott and it certainly could wind up being remembered as even more divisive than its predecessor. Recently, Scott has had a nasty issue of not answering questions. Prometheus, as the beginning of a new prequel trilogy, is obviously loaded with open questions. Now, Covenant is planned to be the final sequential film in the trilogy and, yet, it leaves open questions in the name of having its prequel (and Prometheus' sequel) answer those questions. While this film works for the most part, Ridley Scott really needs to not do this. For its faults, Rogue One got this perfectly with a prequel that answered questions from the original and then just led right up to its beginning. Compared to that one, Covenant is certainly not nearly as fulfilling. This, and Prometheus, are intended to be prequels to the originals, but seem wholly different and not related at all, even if they feature the same beasts. There is a disconnect and, as a result, they are best enjoyed as a new science fiction franchise inspired by Alien."", ""In saying that, it is certainly heavily inspired by Alien. Ridley Scott seems to have abandoned all of the compelling ideas of Prometheus in favor of a greatest hits album from Alien and Alien. With the crew of Covenant armed to the teeth and frequently engaging in shootouts with the xenomorphs, the film constantly calls back to the action roots of James Cameron's brilliant sequel. Meanwhile, Scott tosses in about fifty chest-bursters and face-huggers for lovers of Alien, as well as smart guys touching those weird egg testicle things only to get killed. While the film is undeniably terrifying in its own right, Covenant never really feels like it is treading new ground. Prometheus, for all of its faults, was far more imaginative with its mythology. Covenant, in ditching that and going for the visceral and gory fear of the original, has practically nothing to say. Should Scott follow through on Alien: Awakening, it promises to be far more compelling, as long as it can blend the fear from Covenant with the ideas of Prometheus."", ""That is not to say that Scott abandoned everything from Prometheus, of course. He insisted on keeping the plot holes and vague references to the past that raise questions that, theoretically, will be answered later in the prequel to this film, Awakening. Unfortunately, as the second film and third entry into this film, it is about time we get answers and not more questions. The most egregious example here would be the scene of David unleashing the virus on the Prometheus muscly white dudes. There are two problems with this scene, mostly because it is a flashback. For one, the film is set ten years after Prometheus. In that film, these white dudes are mostly gone. Now, before ten years, it is bursting with life. This is absolutely impossible, so the timeline makes no sense. So, then the next jump is that he arrived beforehand, which is also impossible. As a result, it is a sequence that looks cool, but actually makes no sense whatsoever with what we already know. This misstep hints at how detrimentally underwritten Covenant is and how it seems to even ignore its own timeline."", ""As with any modern blockbuster, one of the key elements of Covenant is obviously its sense of spectacle. With wondrous special effects in Prometheus, one could only hope for the same with this film. Featuring gorgeous ship design - especially the embryo holders, which are a nice touch - and absolutely spectacular special effects in the sequence where the xenomorph gets kicked off of the ship, Covenant is undeniably a visual feast. However, it even has faults here. There is a sequence on the cargo hold where Daniels (Katherine Waterston) fights a xenomorph as Tennessee (Danny McBride) flies the cargo hold and, unfortunately, the effects are dreadful. It is clearly done in front of a green screen with no blending done to make its effects look natural. As a result, it is a scene that sticks out as a sour thumb and never looks natural in the least. It is a scene that has a strong sense of design and is a nice shootout, but it just never works visually as its poor effects completely takes the audience out of the film."" ]";5
981;allied;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""An old school style romantic thriller, Allied feels both modern and cut right out of the 1940s. Gorgeously captured, designed, and staged, Allied is an - at times - lyrical and entirely compelling look at World War II espionage through the eyes of two lovers. Director Robert Zemeckis cannot help but constantly reference Casablanca with his two lovers meeting in a bar in Casablanca, but though the film is deeply indebted to the Golden Age of Hollywood, it is somewhat similar to Steven Soderbergh's The Good German. Another film that I love (sue me), that film attempts to take the style of film noir - going as far as shooting in black-and-white with German expressionist lighting - and tell a story that could have been told in the 1940s. Many found it to be a mess and, admittedly, Tobey Maguire is entirely out of place there. Allied suffered much the same fate as it tried to capture the same appeal of a romance not-really-melodrama-but-sort-of-melodramatic war film akin to the aforementioned Casablanca or another Humphrey Bogart film, To Have and Have Not."", ""That said, Zemeckis does not go the full nine yards like Soderbergh. Instead, he often channels films such as The English Patient or, believe it or not, Children of Men. Both far more recent, the two feel like a clear influence on some of the style of Allied, whereas the story and romance feels ripped out of 1940s cinema. For the former, the comparison is clear: war-set romance tale that partially occurs in the desert. It is clear from the trailer alone that Zemeckis had seen Anthony Minghella's stunning beauty of a film, with its style of desert shots clearly bearing influence as Zemeckis sets up stunning shots of the desert as one of the highlights of the film's cinematography. However, a sex scene in a car in the desert between Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) and Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) appears to also channel Minghella's film with the couple engaging in an extended sex scene as a sandstorm blows all around them. A similar scene also occurs in The English Patient, though without the sex. Instead, Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas simply chat and grow closer due to their small confines. One could argue that the raw passion between the two spies is their own way of sharing war stories like those shared by Fiennes."", ""Yet, Allied's action scenes seem akin to Children of Men. Perhaps not a direct influence, I admit, but a stylistic one nonetheless. Upon viewing Children of Men years ago, I was immediately struck by its action scenes as Clive Owen and company try to shoot their way out of various destroyed buildings. Of every film I have seen, this film still stands as the one that best simulated the action scenes of a video game. It put you in intimate contact with the action and made it feel as though you were doing it yourself. It is is a hard style to describe and it is not due to the POV. Instead, it simply feels like a video game. Allied's action scenes have the same feeling with Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard shooting their way out of the ambassador's ball with bodies flying. The shooting and reactions of the men who are shot feels like a cut scene from a first person shooter as the story progresses before you regain control of the main character. However, the film also feels akin to Alfonso Cuaron's 2006 film in its camera work. Though not a continuous shot or anything, the camera in Allied feels free flowing. It floats around the characters and the locale, hiding behind storefronts or rushing ahead of the characters and awaiting their arrival in the frame or just waiting on the curb after they drove off in the distance. Capturing the beautiful production and costume design, the camera in Allied feels like an entity in and of itself with it trying ambitious shots that were unlikely to be seen in 1940s cinema."", ""Story-wise, the film shows the romance between Max and Marianne and, as the trailer shows, throws a wrench in their marriage with Marianne being accused of being a German spy. Deliberate, tense, and unpredictable, the film ditches the happy ending demanded by 1940s audiences and instead sees it to its logical conclusion: a torn relationship as a result of this accusation. No matter whether it is true or not, what was between them has been snuffed out due to suspicion and uncertainty. Brilliantly portrayed by Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, the two entirely sell both the rise and fall of the relationship. Captured in small subtleties, such as Pitt's Max lurking over Marianne in his uniform as he must go to work on his day off, the slow demise of the relationship due to her possible work as a spy is haunting and heart wrenching. From the excitement of a day off (the beginning) to the slow and sad realization that the one you love must leave (the fall), Allied captures the gorgeous nuances of this relationship in great detail. Though occurring during WWII and various bombings, the center of this film is always its two lovers."" ]";5
982;fences;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Denzel Washington's Fences is undoubtedly a flawed work. With its screenplay written by the play's writer August Wilson, Fences is a film that is entirely connected to the stage. With dialogue heavy scene after dialogue heavy scene for two hours, Fences can be an exasperating film to watch with how much of it is relying upon nothing but words. For two plus hours, this is undeniably a major challenge and one that can prove too much at times. However, it is in those words that the beauty of Fences reveals itself. Brilliantly written with aching roots in reality, Fences is certainly a tremendously acted film, but the star here is August Wilson's writing. It is vibrant. It is raw. It is emotional. It is, above all else, real. The film's writing is what gives it fire in the first place and the what brings it triumphantly over the finish line. No matter where the film may slack, creak, or trip, the script is always there to pick it up and point it in the right direction."", ""While Wilson's eloquent use of language to have the characters express their emotion without having to come out and have the characters say exactly what they feel serving as terrific footing for the film, it is his ability to develop those characters that will stand the test of time. As a challenge for this, Wilson sets the film in 1950s Pittsburgh in the inner city and in the home of a garbage collector named Troy (Denzel Washington). With a wife named Rose (Viola Davis) and a son with her named Cory (Jovan Adepo), a son with another woman named Lyons (Russell Hornsby), a brother dealing with mental illness named Gabe (Mykelti Williamson), and a friend named Bono (Stephen Henderson), Troy's life is one of fear. At every turn, this big behemoth of a man is afraid. Projecting confidence and aggression to mask this fear, Troy compartmentalizes his fear into baseball references and elaborate stories of how he fights off death. Yet, underneath the surface, he is a man who knows he has already struck out and is nearing death. As he pushes away his son Cory and derails his dream of playing football, Troy also antagonizes Lyons, signs away Gabe to the state, and cheats on Rose. He is a man who is failing and struggling to stay afloat and to keep a roof over his family's heads, all while bearing the weight of that burden. He is a man who is so afraid that he will fail and be rejected by his family that he winds up crushing himself under the weight of it all and pushes away some of his family in the process. Of all the people in the world, Rose is the one who sees this. As Cory leaves and even Bono leaves, Rose stands by her philandering husband and even raises the daughter he has with another woman. Why? Because she sees him for what he truly is on the inside. No matter how abrasive he is and how aggressive of a person he can be, Troy is just scared and latching onto anything he can in order to not fall or to forget that he is falling. The thought of death, though he approaches it with great machismo, is something that scares him. He refuses to admit he did not go pro in baseball because of his age, instead blaming it on the whites. Why? Because that would require admitting he is old. When Cory challenges him, he only fights back when Cory calls him old. He is a man afraid of growing old and dying. Rose, for the the pain he has caused her, refuses to give upon this man. Instead, she opts to stand by him and hold his hand as he slowly and loudly slips out of this world. Though it would be easier to leave him to rot in the bed that he had made for himself, she loves that man that has become consumed by fear and refuses to let herself become consumed by that very same fear. Instead, she fights back and declares war on it in order to provide her husband with the strength he needs to fight back as well."", ""One of the greatest challenges undertaken by Fences is to make Troy likable. For the part of Rose, Viola Davis' brilliant and raw performance combines with Wilson's eloquent writing to make her the one we root for. When Cory takes on his father to defend his mother, we want him to kick his ass. Every time Troy lets down Rose, we want her to leave him and for Rose to kick his butt. Yet, she never does. This could make Rose seem to be quite the confounding character if Troy remains this detestable person that we cannot root for. On the surface, he is an angry, self-hating, narcissistic, and cruel man. He treats his sons like garbage and his wife even worse. His words are hollow and leave you longing for a better man to step into his place. So, how does Wilson make Troy a man you can root for, even with Denzel going full \""You know what I'm talkin' 'bout **** Partially, it is because of Rose, but the rest is because of how he writes Troy. In his boasting and reminiscing, you can hear that tinge of emotion. Denzel does an excellent job bringing it to life, but the writing gives it the beating heart to open those lungs."" ]";5

Both show a main character grow up and undergo otherwise mundane experiences, but those experiences are things that leave an indelible mark on him for the rest of his life. Moonlight, however, is different in scope. It is a journey of self-discovery undertaken by a man who is decidedly \""other\"". He is black and living in the inner city with a drug addict mother and a drug dealing man who looks after him a bit. He is - as he will discover - gay. This is tough as a whole, but especially in the hypermasculine environment in which he lives. For Chiron, life is a minefield and one he must navigate or simply be consumed by it, all while figuring out who he is and what he wants."", ""Barry Jenkins' film gracefully slides through Miami with Chiron and his life, while properly giving weight to each significant moment in his life. Jenkins let's the camera linger, while Chiron - never much of a talker - rarely ever says anything. This allows the moment to really land on the audience, which makes Moonlight a film that is entirely heartbreaking. From a bullied youngster who first experiences being called a **** to a teen who has his first gay experience while finally fighting back against the bullies to an adult who has become everything he once stood against, Moonlight is an enriching and tragic film."", ""However, Moonlight is equally a look at the black experience in America, particularly in the inner city. Chiron's father is gone. His mother, Paula (Naomie Harris), is a drug addict. The only people who show him any love are Juan (Mahershala Ali) and his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae). However, Juan is a drug dealer and sells to Chiron's mother. Clearly, his life is far from neat. When introducing his sexuality, his relationship with Kevin is all the more complicated by both's need to display masculinity on the outside, which leads to them physically hurting one another often. There is a connection between them - highlighted by the brilliant acting of both's final version, Trevante Rhodes as Chiron and Andre Holland as Kevin - but it is not one that can be explored due to the barriers between them. The look Kevin gives Chiron reveals all you need to know about how they feel about one another. Yet, it is hardly an option for either due to the need to look tough."", ""In all areas, Jenkins' script is phenomenal. Truly nuanced character development, which allows all characters to show growth and a variety of dimensions and faces they show to the world. However, one of the greatest accomplishments is Juan. Mahershala Ali is being mentioned for an Oscar nomination and he certainly deserves one, but the writing is equally good. A sensitive, yet hard nosed drug dealer, Juan helps out Chiron whenever his mom kicks him out. He defends him and opens his home to him, while acting as a father figure for this lost child. Yet, he is a drug dealer. In reality, Juan is a foreshadowing of what Chiron will become. This is incredibly tragic and certainly something Chiron is aware of by the end. He knows his life is not built to last due to dealing drugs, but he is there because he never knew who he was and could never figure it out, because of his own thoughts on how a black man from the inner city should act. Juan reveals a lot of this, merely through his interactions with a young Chiron, especially his solemn regret when Chiron calls him out for selling drugs to Chiron's mother. The similarities between the two (the doo-rag, the poor relationship with their mother, drug dealing, etc.) are numerous and often quite subtle. However, it reveals their connection and why they were drawn to one another."", ""Moonlight is also beautifully shot, essentially relying upon the light of the moon to give sequences at night this sort of magical glow. Each scene at night is obviously quite dark, but the faces of the actors are glistened with this sort of hazy glow that really defines the look of this film. And what a look it is. Moonlight is a beautifully shot film with tremendous lighting and this beauty equally matches the beauty of its journey."", ""A tale of self-discovery and losing yourself to your environment, Moonlight is a moving and tragic film that will stick in your mind for weeks to come. All of the acting is tremendous and to pick a standout performance would be far too difficult. Every actor brought an authentic quality to their role, which is fantastic to see given the tremendously written characters."" ]";5

That said, its cliches and beats are all quite predictable and while director Ben Younger's film tells a true story, it remains entirely predictable and never shocks along the way. It is a largely quite palatable film that for those unconvinced by boxing films as a whole, it will hardly produce any converts. For those that enjoy boxing movies, like myself, it is like a decent slice of pizza from the place near campus that people write off as just \""drunk food\"". It is not drunk food though, it is actually pretty okay, I swear."", ""Starring Miles Teller as Vinnie \""The Pazmanian Devil\"" Paziena, a rough and tough Italian boxer from Providence, Bleed for This goes to great lengths to show how inspiring and unifying his tale is for his family. After losing three bouts in a row, jumping weight classes, and winning his second title belt, Vinnie is in a serious car accident that breaks his neck. Like every proud man before him, he refuses to give up and defies doctors orders to take it easy by working out and making a boxing comeback. He even goes so far as having the screws from his halo - used to stabilize his neck with the screws driven into the skull - removed without anesthetic. We get it, you are tough. Vinnie Paz definitely would frequent The Salty Spitoon from Spongebob, no doubt about that. The high-level of testosterone on display in this film is matched by the excessive sequences in strip clubs, Vinnie's various gorgeous girlfriends (Christine Evangelista mainly), and the shots of the ring girls during boxing matches. The fights ultimately wind up following a sequence of boxing -> bleeding -> boxing -> babe -> pep talk and repeat. That said, the fights still pack all the required tension and cathartic release once the bout is over. In this, the climax reaches a really fever pitch and, though you know the result, it still makes your heart sing with joy."", ""What does truly benefit Bleed for This is the focus on Paz's family. His father (Ciaran Hinds) is at every match, his mother (Katey Sagal) prays in a very Catholic fashion and refuses to watch, and his sisters and their husbands gather around the television to root him on. Cutting from shots of the fight to the Pazeina household, Younger finds incredibly power in this family unity and gives the film incredible heart. Though Paz's story alone supplies a lot of heart, few boxing movies integrate the family as much as this one, turning Bleed for This into a film that shows the impact a career in boxing has on the family as a whole."", ""Compared to recent boxing movies such as Creed, however, Bleed for This is hardly as impressive. The boxing scenes are shot pretty typically and the film lacks the feeling of being a spectacle. Rather, it is as if just goes through checking off boxes on the boxing biopic cliche list. Fortunately, the cliches work incredibly well and the film is quite powerful due to its real life story, but it just never feels innovative or compelling for non-athletic reasons. Even films like 2015's Southpaw add in some further depth to its largely straight forward boxing tale with some innovative trauma. Bleed for This, though incredible in real life, feels like every underdog or comeback story about a man told he can never come back. In essence, what I am trying to say, is the film feels like Million Dollar Baby if Hilary Swank boxed again. This is not bad and it is the true story, but it just feels so safe and typical as a result of this."", ""With strong acting and an uplifting true story, Bleed for This is a film loaded with testosterone and heart, but it follows the tried and true boxing cliches far too closely to be anything more than just another boxing movie about an underdog defeating the incredible odds before him."" ]";5

Somehow the directorial debut of Kelly Fremon Craig, the film is polished, smart, witty, and a poignant look at the depressed/ostracized teenager of today. While now a trendy topic, The Edge of Seventeen still remains an important film due to its approach to growing up in the digital age. While an incredibly funny film, it still manages to pull back the curtain on depression and shows what low self-esteem can do to a person who is already on the outskirts of the social world. In a powerhouse performance, Hailee Steinfeld grabs the film by the reins and steers it home, furthering cementing her status as a rising star in the acting world. At her side, Woody Harrelson turns in his best performance in years."", ""The Edge of Seventeen focuses on 17-year old Nadine (Steinfeld). Different from the other kids, she has always had trouble making friends. However, her best friend - Krista (Haley Lu Richardson) - has been with her since second grade. Since that time, Nadine's father - her at-home best friend - died. Now, she is stuck with depression, a brother who is popular, and a mother who has never gotten on well with her. All of this is the formula for Nadine's breakdown when Krista begins to date Nadine's brother, Darian (Blake Jenner). Everything Nadine is not, she feels deeply hurt that her best friend has betrayed her and, in Nadine's eyes, grown past her."", ""A poignant film, The Edge of Seventeen has many cliches from the wise teacher to the meet-cute with a guy in Nadine's class, as well as her fumbling through a potential sexual encounter with her dream guy. That said, it still brings enough originality through Nadine. Incredibly well-written and fleshed out, Nadine's struggles are universal with some tremendous dialogue along the way that really highlights her inner-feelings. Particularly, at the end when she describes how she likes to imagine she is the only one with problems to, potentially, feel unique. A moving scene, this moment really underscores what is Nadine's problem and why she struggles to fit in. Her own worst enemy, she projects negative intentions on others due to her own low self-esteem. She assumes people cannot like her or love her because of her own insecurities. A throwaway line, yet one of the best, comes from Krista. When Nadine is nearing getting over Krista dating Darian, Krista says, \""I missed her.\"" Though Nadine may not love herself, others do. Krista does. Darian does. Mona (Kyra Sedgwick), her mother, does. Hell, Mr. Bruner (Harrelson), her history teacher, does. If only she can stop hating herself, her eyes would be opened to how much she is loved. That said, it is easier said than done."", ""Insightful into the struggle of a teenage girl to find the ability to love herself, The Edge of Seventeen is often moving, largely due to its authenticity. Each character acts like a real human being and speaks as though they were one as well. The situations are universal, especially for those who were unpopular in high school. In  this way, it manages to be incredibly impactful with Craig able to create a film that is truly poignant without being sentimental or schmaltzy. It hits home because it is real, not because it is manipulative."", ""While the drama element is tremendously written, so is the comedy. Largely coming from Woody Harrelson or Hayden Szeto (who plays Erwin Kim - a boy who likes Nadine). The dry humor and deadpan delivery of Harrelson's Mr. Bruner is a lot of this films charm. Every scene Harrelson is in, he steals it completely. Similarly, the love-struck and awkward Erwin is brought to life through tremendously awkward and nerdy delivery by Szeto. Every encounter between him and Nadine is imbued with the curiosity, awkwardness, and uncertainty of all potential teenage romances, which - again - makes it incredibly impactful. While witty and incredibly funny, The Edge of Seventeen strikes an excellent balance between the comedy and the drama that few films can ever dream of accomplishing. Jokes do not obstruct here. They add and come at terrific times with great delivery by all."", ""Poignant and funny, The Edge of Seventeen is a tremendous debut from Kelly Fremon Craig. Many have compared her to a modern day John Hughes and maybe this is true, but I need to see more before making the comparison. As it stands, this is a terrific debut with great direction, phenomenal acting, and writing that is smart, witty, and respectful of its characters, even when their struggles are somewhat self-created.

986;frank-lola;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The directorial debut of Matthew Ross, Frank & Lola is an excellent debut film. While merely an above average film, the film often feels like the debut of a soon-to-be great filmmaker. Showing great intuition when it comes to storytelling and some very cool camera shots along the way, Ross shows that he knows how to direct a film. However, as with all debuts, Frank & Lola merely feels unpolished. If you look closely, you can still see the brush strokes on the canvas. Under the leadership of a more seasoned director, Frank & Lola could have been the best erotic noir thriller in a long time. Under the watch of Ross, however, it is merely a hint at what is to come. This is also the film where I learned that it is Imogen Poots not Imogen Potts. I have no idea why I thought that, but I have even tagged her as Imogen Potts on multiple reviews."", ""A deeply sexual film, Frank & Lola's greatest tricks are the camera. There are numerous shots that are incredible and shows that Ross has a tremendous eye for visuals. One such shot is of Frank (Michael Shannon) following Alan (Michael Nyqvist) in Paris. Influenced by the films of Alfred Hitchcock, this voyeuristic sequence would certainly be at home in one of his films or one by Brian De Palma. This comparison becomes more apt when considering the voyeurism in the context of the film. Deeply jealous and obsessed, Frank is one half of the \""rotten\"" relationship with Lola (Imogen Poots). Similar to De Palma or Hitchcock, Ross expends a lot of energy exploring Frank's jealousy and obsession. Though Lola gives him plenty of reason to be worried, Frank is deeply obsessed with her and her every move. Him telling her that when he wakes up, he thinks about her is hardly a sign of love. Rather, it is a sign that he is dangerously obsessed with her and could wind up hurting her. Throughout, Frank is shown to be a violent man as he attacks Alan and attacks a man who is beating a girl in a bar. In many ways, it could be argued this anger is facing inward as he fights those who act on his inclinations. He never hurts Lola, but certainly feels possessive and hates to see men who acts this way or who infringe upon his ownership of Lola and her body. This obsession is certainly a theme of Hitchcock and De Palma's work, as is voyeurism, showing that Ross is certainly influenced by both. Though I am hardly calling him the new incarnation of those two, he certainly has the potential and is willing to indulge in similar themes."", ""Ross also shows an inclination towards mirror shots, which I am always a big fan of. The best one coming at the very end after Frank goes to the kitchen and returns to where Lola is sitting, except she is gone. As he walks to the bar, the camera is standing outside a doorway looking into the room. Adjacent to the door is a mirror where you can see Frank. Next to that, along the door frame, is another mirror where Lola can be seen. The focus then racks to highlight Lola's forlorn look, certainly hinting that things are likely over between her and Frank. This shot is truly incredible and shows that visual skill possessed by Ross."", ""However, as mentioned before, the film is certainly unpolished. Though visually stylish, the story is pretty scattershot. The themes are good, but the film's plot is unfocused and jumps freely between Las Vegas and Paris. Much of the plot merely feels like an exercise in camera movement and utilizing various lighting and color schemes. While very pretty to look at, the plot is incredibly disposable and hardly engaging. The characters are pretty one-note and, while the themes are interesting, the characters are not terribly well-written. Poots' character is mostly just crazy and Shannon's just broods and tries to control Lola. While the acting is very good here, especially by Shannon, the plot and characters are incredibly underwritten. This leaves the film feeling quite hollow. It does not strike a balance between being stylish over substance as even the most stylish films have great substance via plot and characters, even if minimalist. Frank & Lola's plot is not minimalist, it is non-existent."", ""The directorial debut of Matthew Ross, Frank & Lola shows that Ross is a man to keep an eye on. Many great directors have an unpolished debut and, personally, I believe this to be Ross's. With terrific camera work via mirrors and voyeurism and themes of obsession, Ross takes a lot of cues from Hitchcock and De Palma in this film. While it is certainly a high bar to achieve, it is clear that he has great potential and I am eagerly anticipating his next work."" ]";5
987;loving;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The most low-key work by director Jeff Nichols, Loving is a slow, moving, and reserved film about two very reserved people. Telling the story of Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Mildred Loving (Ruth Negga), Loving recounts their love, their marriage, and the legal battle that legalized interracial marriage nationwide. A truly historic case, Loving is not concerned with the courtroom. Rather, it is a love story about two unassuming country folk who fell in love. That said, in doing this, Loving loses the climax of their \""freedom\"", opting to focus upon their relationship and given the silent, stoic nature of the couple. This leaves the film lacking the impactful ending demanded by the importance of the case. However, with great direction, acting, and cinematography, Loving does manage to overcome its camera shy approach to telling this story."", ""Two shy people, the Loving's are brilliantly brought to life by Edgerton and Negga. Though, on watching, their performances are so slight they evade detection. As such, the viewer is forced to peel back to the onion and, upon doing so, the emotion of the film is revealed. However, it is still very subtle and comes in non-noteworthy actions, embraces, or delivery of lines. For example, the famed photo of Richard resting his head in Mildred's lap that was published in Life Magazine is one such moment. Tender, subtle, and entirely romantic, as is the rest of the film, this moment encapsulates the beauty of their romance. In a similar tone, Richard telling his lawyer Bernard Cohen (Nick Kroll) to tell the Supreme Court that he \""loves his wife\"" is a truly powerful moment amplified by Edgerton's delivery. Thus, it is undeniable that both Negga and Edgerton turned in stellar performances. Though more low-key than many performances and, should either win, it will largely be criticized by the general public, both are worthy nominees. That said, Kroll is quite bad here. He struggles to fit in and appears ready to make a joke at any turn. The fact I laughed when he was first shown is indicative that he is not ready for a dramatic role. His acting did little to change my mind, as he seemed like a comedic actor punching above his weight class."", ""The film's cinematography is also great and fully embraced by Nichols. With slow drawn out sequences, Nichols allows the camera to really soak in the beauty of the scenery and farm country. In many ways, the visuals are a love letter to the rural environment that Nichols so clearly loves in each of his films. Furthermore, once again, the best shot here comes in a car. From over Edgerton's shoulder, there is a great shot in a car and, just as in Midnight Special, a shot of cars speeding ahead with the headlights glowing on the road are terrific. Nichols seems to favor this shot lately and his films' look definitely benefit from this affection."", ""However, the film is held back by its commitment to its couple. Just as low-key and shy as its protagonists, Loving is an unassuming and quiet film. As such, it can be quite slow and, at the end, devoid of emotional punch. For such a landmark case, its emotional climax comes and goes with rapid speed. Though the decision to focus on the romance and not the courtroom elements help the film not feel as tedious as a courtroom film often can, it does hurt the film by losing the weight and power of the case that it depicts. Loving v. Virginia is a landmark decision and had the film at least shown the decision being delivered without any of the arguments, it would have been a film with incredible emotion and a terrific climax. Instead, the audience gets the decision on the other end of the phone. While true to its characters, Loving's conclusion to its case does not fit thematically or entertainment-wise."", ""As a whole, Loving may be my least favorite work by Nichols, though I have yet to see Shotgun Stories. That said, it is still a beautiful and lyrical experience that is a love letter to love and country living. Though it lacks the punch I hoped it would have, its tenderly depicted and written romance is tremendous."" ]";5
988;hacksaw-ridge;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Mel Gibson, along with Martin Scorsese, has a finger on the pulse of Christianity. In The Passion of the Christ, Gibson's much maligned film, he brilliantly captures Jesus and his essence. Though many hate the film, it is a personal favorite of mine. Powerful and brilliantly capturing Jesus through the eyes, rather than words, Gibson's film is one that struck at my very core. Hacksaw Ridge did the exact same thing, but rather than showing Jesus himself, he shows how the words of Jesus and actions of those who follow Him can transform lives. Transcending human definitions of courage, the powerful true story of Desmond Doss - a conscientious objector who saved 75 lives on Hacksaw Ridge as a medic - is a brilliantly told and entirely powerful film. For those who are not religious, the film may come home as hokey and corny, which are fair criticisms. But, as a Christian, I ate it up with a spoon and went back for seconds."", ""Perhaps the biggest flaw of Hacksaw Ridge is how it wears its influences on its sleeve. In particular, Full Metal Jacket. With the first half being set in basic training with a hard-nosed and funny drill instructor, Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn), and the second half coming full force with violence, explosions, and shooting, the film lacks the thematic ruminations of Full Metal Jacket while embracing their visceral impact. It is hardly original in this set-up and it is unfortunate that Gibson just ripped off that film - it transcends influence - and gave it his religious twist. The film's first half is also further maligned by cliches with the introduction of Doss's wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer). Sweet and romantic, the romance always feel incredibly nostalgic and innocent, but never really feeds into his character development too much. The picture in the Bible or the picture as a \""Oh wait, I almost forgot\"" gift from a girlfriend to her boyfriend heading off to war is a tried and true cliche that is about reaching the end of its run too, right? The cliches of the first half and then the Full Metal Jacket structure render the first half largely being the weaker one by far."", ""Fortunately, the second half is impeccable. Bloody and brutal, the film's violence can be a bit numbing, but is beautifully captured. Expert staging and choreography plus brilliant cinematography with an emphasis on the greens and browns of battle and bombs, contrasted by the deep blood red of violence, the film is absolutely terrific. It may be a bit comically over-the-top, but Gibson painstakingly captures both the strategy and the violence of war, infusing it all with great tension and thrills. While many cite the second half as being far weaker (as they do with Full Metal Jacket), it is brilliant in my opinion. Yet, one of its greatest complaints is how it contrasts with the first half and the pacifism on display there. Personally, I see no issue. Desmond wanted to go to war and this is war. He knew there would be blood, so the audience and the film understand there must be blood. It is a war film and though Doss's tale is vastly different than many other soldiers, it still must show the brutal reality of war and Gibson does so brilliantly."", ""Yet, the film finds its greatest power in the last half hour. As Doss races back and saves 75 different men, painfully lowering them down the ridge after his own men had long gone aside from two guards, the film turns into Church. Begging God to let him save one more and asking God what his purpose is in this battle, the film is moving, powerful, and entirely resonant. Though a bit preachy, Gibson's film shows the struggle for Christians in violent situations or the world as a whole. With chaos all around, how do we live up to Jesus' example? Where are we needed and what is our purpose in this world? Doss is confronted with these questions in the heat of the moment and must act quickly, performing what he believes to be God's purpose for him in war. With his bravery and courage quietly performed, Doss is a man that serves as pure inspiration for anybody searching for this purpose in this world as an agent of God or anybody seeking to be brave in an unconventional fashion."", ""A striking tale of bravery with a tinge of pacifism and an anti-war message, Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful, riveting, and truly gorgeous film. Just as with The Passion of the Christ, it play more resoundingly with Christian audiences, but it is a great war film in its own right. It may be too cliched and influenced by other war films at points, but Gibson knows violence and uses that knowledge to craft brilliantly smart battle sequences that resonate nearly as much as its appeals to its Christian target audience. Hokey and corny, Hacksaw Ridge is the cinematic version of Church and plays strongly at fears of Christian persecution. Yet, in spite of that, it is undeniably powerful and a terrific film for audiences willing to go along with its spiritual core."" ]";5
989;the-handmaiden;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Woof. The Handmaiden is one perverse piece of eroticism. An erotic thriller that shows mastery of suspense akin to Alfred Hitchcock, but with a blending of eroticism akin to Brian De Palma, Paul Verhoeven, or Adrian Lyne, The Handmaiden is a brutally violent and erotic film. Blending eroticism with extreme violence like that found in films such as Basic Instinct, The Handmaiden is a lovingly crafted film that is equal parts horrifying and titillating throughout its run time. Though it suffers from Park Chan-wook's films always feeling too distant and disconnected (personal opinion), The Handmaiden's stark beauty is impossible to deny and this is what lifts it above his other films for me. That said, the plot's suspense and thrills are secondary to the visual beauty of this film, which is striking."", ""Changing the novel's location from Victorian England to Korea under Japanese rule, Park Chan-wook's film still feels Victorian. With the regality and the building design often reflecting the castles and mansions one could find in Victorian England, The Handmaiden still shows that influence. Yet, of course, these buildings are entirely Japanese/Korean. The interior design reflects this in the home of Uncle Kouzuki (Cho Jin-woong), as it is entirely Japanese and feels like something one could find in a film by Akira Kurosawa. Lavish, regal, and alive in its own rights, these buildings are intricate, detailed, and absolutely lovely. The interior and the exterior are gorgeous with the camera finding just the right ways to capture this beauty. Often shooting from behind the trees, the home is usually somewhat obscured in the darkness, instilling an ominous feeling about this place. The trees add to the distance communicated by the entire film, as Park Chan-wook never fully let's you in and keeps you an arm's length away from the proceedings. This is captured in the cinematography, but even then, the visuals are strikingly gorgeous."", ""This production design is further felt by the aforementioned cinematography that takes full advantage of the beauty on display. Every shot is gorgeous and lovingly crafted. Not a single frame of this film feels out of place and really flows together and is entirely engrossing. This is a dark, disturbing film, but the visuals communicate an odd beauty and romance to this violence and disturbing level of sexuality. Of course, it is benefited by the framing and staging. Every moment is precise, definitive, and decisive. Not a foot is put wrong in this film where each actor communicating their character brilliantly and breathing life into the film with every step they take. It is the movement of the characters that makes this a full-fledged visual masterpiece as it manages to add yet another layer to visual approach of this film. Beyond the production design, staging, and cinematography, the costume design is also brilliant with each design representing the lavish and royal lifestyle of its characters. The design's are intricate, well put together, and lovely to look at throughout the film."", ""Though an erotic psychological thriller with a penchant for violence and disturbing moments, The Handmaiden is also darkly comedic. For instance, one such comedy scene finds Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) holding up Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee) to prevent her from hanging herself. Upon learning distressing news, she runs off to cry only to quickly realize she has left her Ladyship strangling herself from the branch. Additionally, the multiple depictions of tentacles and the octopus in the basement are hysterical tongue-in-cheek additions by Park. And of course, the scene where Hideko has intercourse - supposedly - with a knife. Really off-the-wall, uncensored, and truly outrageous moments that add some darkly comic twists to a film that is dark, dark, dark."", ""Sexually, The Handmaiden is very much like a Verhoeven film. Though more pristine and less gritty, the scenes are shot to titillate. Park Chan-wook exploits his seemingly lesbian characters for the enjoyment of male viewers with classic lesbian sex scenes occurring that, regardless of their practicality, exist solely to entertain the male audience. This is very much like what people like De Palma or Verhoeven would include in their film, though it would be shot differently. Park Chan-wook's stages these sex scenes almost symmetrically at times and very rigidly. The scenes are tense, sensual, and almost regal is how they appear and look. It feels more like a Todd Haynes sex scene from Carol in this regard, as it feels pristine. Now, of course, Haynes' lesbian sex moment is far more withdrawn and focused on the passion and love. It is intimate, not exploitative. The Handmaiden exploits its characters' sexuality for the purposes of male entertainment, which is a shame."" ]";5

Overlong with a plot that takes a bit too long to get to the good bits and the tearjerking, The Light Between Oceans receives such high marks for me for one reason: the cinematography. In my ever-so-humble opinion, all of the film's problems are reduced to ash when compared to the everlasting, remarkable beauty of the film. For me, it is easily one of the most beautifully shot films of all-time. Without question. Where it ranks amongst films in terms of cinematography is debatable, but this film is not just eye candy. It is an eye buffet."", """", ""The film's plot has to be its weakest element alongside its pacing. A little slow and a little too manipulative at times, The Light Between Oceans keeps shoving melodrama at you and expects you to cry. When it fails, it shoves another handful in your face and shows discontent when you do not begin to bawl. That said, it does manage to get you a few times, especially with the love between Tom (Michael Fassbender) and Isabel (Alicia Vikander), as well as in scenes between Isabel and Lucy, These scenes really tug on the heartstrings and are effective at their goal. In particular, the final letter from Tom to Isabel, as well as the one from Isabel to Lucy really knock you on the ground in fits of crying. This is largely in part to the strong characterization of the major players, as well as the sensual chemistry between Fassbender and Vikander. They just worked together very well and the film benefits tremendously from their irresistible chemistry."", """", ""However, as hinted to before, the film takes a little too long to get into things. It lays the groundwork very well, but some better pacing could have helped out this issue. It just felt like the final 3/4's were dedicated to the actual drama of the film. Before that, the first act just kept chugging along and developing the love between Tom and Isabel. While it is a very well developed love story - not so much romance, but certainly love - it is simply unbalanced. It needs more the drama and less of the melo."", """", ""Now, pushing those issues aside, the cinematography made me want to run around the theater shouting, \""F*** YES\"". I had to scrape my jaw off the ground multiple times with the beauty of the cinematography and I am not just talking about the beautiful aerial shots of the water. Whether it was cliffs, a shot in the distance from the lighthouse, a shot of the sunset, or shots of the waves crashing ashore, those shots are easily identified as being beautiful. These shots do not set it apart. Instead, what sets it apart are scenes such as the one in which Lucy goes missing. While the scene may be a little filler in the film to a degree, there is no way it could be cut because of the shot of the search party with flashlights in the dark. Brilliantly framed and truly arresting, the cinematography of that scene in particular was so perfect it caused me physical pain. As an overall, the film often takes the feeling of an old-time picture with a goldish hue giving the film the appropriate period look and almost a dose of nostalgia for the 1920s. This goldish hue is truly gorgeous and really blends perfectly with the aforementioned shots of the ocean. Together, all of these wind up producing a truly arresting and visually immaculate film. If this one does not get serious nominations for Best Cinematography, the film gods should blind all voters because they are not using their eyes for their intended purpose."", """", ""As a whole, The Light Between Oceans is flawed. A hit-and-miss tearjerker, it is certainly overlong and a little manipulative. That said, I really could care less. The cinematography is not just a 10/10. It is a 500/10. It is that good. Not since I watched Days of Heaven or The New World by Terence Malick have I been this awe struck by the cinematography of a film. There are times when I obviously find it beautiful, but nothing like this. The Light Between Oceans, from grand sweeping shots over the ocean to shots in the town to the slight gold filter on the film, is truly a sight to behold."" ]";5
991;nocturnal-animals;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Nocturnal Animals is the second film by director Tom Ford and, likewise, it is the second film I have seen from him. The famed fashion designer known for his visual style fleshes this out in Nocturnal Animals, starring Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal. Telling the story of a woman who reads the novel of her ex-husband and slowly realizes it has a basis in reality, Nocturnal Animals is a tense, thrilling, and visually arresting film, but it does get a bit too caught up in its style to be anything truly spectacular. As it stands though, it is still a very good sophomore effort from Ford in the director’s chair."", ""As with A Single Man, Nocturnal Animals’ greatest asset is its visuals. The stunning cinematography is not the only area of this, but it is where I will start. The best shot, to me, was of Edward Sheffield (Gyllenhaal) running from the desert to the road and through a barbed wire. Focused on the desert, Gyllenhaal enters the frame at a distance from the right and the camera never moves. No close-up, nothing. Rather, he still in the far third of the screen. The end result is a beautifully staged shot that, for whatever reason, really worked for me. Similarly, gratuitous shots of the desert are a personal favorite of mine and apparently Ford too, given how often he used them. Similarly, shots of cars driving at night or simply the Texas landscape prove to be gorgeous shots. However, as is expected, Ford has a eye for style. From terrific costumes for Amy Adams, great make-up/hairstyling, and great production design with a stunning level of detail, Ford creates a truly beautiful world that makes you want to cloak yourself in its aesthetic appeal."", ""In terms of its plot, Nocturnal Animals occurs in both the non-fictional and fictional with the latter being in Susan's mind as she reads Edward's novel. As she reads, Ford often cuts between her reading and Edward and Sheriff Andes's (Michael Shannon) reenactment of the story. As it progresses, however, Ford often cuts between Susan and fictional Edward doing the exact same thing. Showering. Rising out of a bath. Showering again. Laying in bed in opposite directions. Here, Ford tries to create a connection between the fictional and non-fictional, but undeniably becomes far too focused on creating artistic appeal than anything else. The cuts are pretty, but feel far too indulgent to really land with much power. Fortunately, the plot does save this element with powerful stories that parallel one another. It is clear that Ford is evidently pro-life in this film given his portrayal of abortion in both worlds. Yet, it is incredibly interesting to watch this parallel come together in the plot and even in the title (a nickname given to Susan by real Edward). This is really where much of the intrigue of Nocturnal Animals comes in as, otherwise, it would just  be a pretty typical revenge thriller. Here, it adds another layer and, as such, becomes a truly compelling work worthy of further study."", ""Performance-wise, I would be lying if I said Michael Shannon did not steal the show. As a hard-nosed cop who violently throws up often due to his lung cancer, Shannon does not put on a Texas accent to disappear into his role. Rather, he carries himself with the attitude and swagger of a Texas sheriff and, simply by seeing him walk into frame, you know he means business. Gyllenhaal is also terrific here as the grief stricken Tony Hastings in the fictional world. Powerful and intense, Gyllenhaal brings to the forefront Tony's personal issues with his/Edward's own masculinity and being called \""weak\"". Often moved to anguish, Gyllenhaal - though upstaged by Shannon - continues his hot streak of terrific roles and performances. Compared to the men, Adams is far more low-key. Her role is far more subdued and subtle. She plays the role terrifically well, however, capturing the emotionless nature of her character, never showcasing the slightest hint of being broken or phased by those around her."", ""The best piece of Nocturnal Animals is its visuals. Haunting, arresting, and simply gorgeous to view, they are certainly bolstered by a good score that rises at the perfect moments and great acting. Yet, Ford's willingness to indulge in his artistic endeavors far too often do hold the film back a bit, notably during the cross-cutting between Adams and Gyllenhaal and the opening sequence. In this way, Nocturnal Animals is certainly beautifully imperfect."" ]";5

He is guy that claims to be \""one for them, one for me\"", but his films continuously seem to be \""one for America, and then another for America\"" at this point. Deepwater Horizon is no different. Yet, it is somehow a good film with a great sense of scope. A celebration of average joe heroes who saved lives during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the negligence on the part of BP that led to this disaster, Deepwater Horizon is an accessible, smart, and powerful film that may pull a little too hard on the viewer's heart strings at the end, but is undeniably thrilling and a riveting portrayal of the disaster. It is not a film that rushes to the finale, rather building tension until the pressure is too much and the whole thing blows up into a cloud of fire."", ""Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) is the Chief Electric Technician on the Deepwater Horizon. James \""Mr. Jimmy\"" Harrell (Kurt Russell) is the head honcho. The two show incredible courage throughout the escapade and save people left and right, even after they are battered and broken. Casting Wahlberg and Russell in these roles is a stroke of genius as they are perfect fits for these modern heroes. Going above and beyond the call of duty, the men sacrifice themselves and their bodies to try and save as many people as possible. Racing across the ship to try a last ditch effort to save the rig and then jumping from the rig itself, Mike Williams' actions after the explosion are incredible, including saving multiple men from the accommodations. Injured and with one eye swollen shut, Mr. Jimmy is a man that never stops to take his hand off the wheel. Once he gets up, he is not going down again until everybody is safe and the rig is clear. Even afterwards, he calls roll to determine who made it off and who lost their lives. Wahlberg and Russell are classic tough guys and really show why in this film with good performances as these real life heroes."", ""Yet, this really drives at the point of the film. Williams in particular gets the most character development of anybody with a wife and daughter waiting his return at home. He is a family man, the quintessential American. With a single American flag waving on the ship and in the aftermath (oh the national anthem call out, \""THE FLAG STILL WAVING OR WHATEVER\""...i.e. the flag is still waving as the rig burns in the background, poetic and overtly patriotic), Berg stuffs the heroism down our throat, but makes it work. The film is tense, thrilling, and action-packed. He may go too American and too hard on the celebration of heroes in this one, but these men do deserve praise for their actions and then patriotism is limited to just a few shots. In essence, he reins it in a bit for this one and lets the men do the talking."", ""However, the key to this film is the explosion and the ensuing fire. With phenomenal sound effects and tremendous visual effects, this is where the huge budget for the film went it paid off. The film will probably not be profitable because of the budget being too high, but as a film, it really paid dividends. The film U-571 is still cited as one of the best films to test to see if a new sound system is working out well, but it may need to be updated to Deepwater Horizon. The sound is simply that good. The explosion, the chaos, and all of the tension leading up to it is impeccable and really what this film rides on throughout. Without it, Deepwater Horizon would not be nearly as good as it, especially considering how little meat is on this bone.  Using a pair of men as scapegoats for everything and not covering the punishments faced by BP, the film does include some real court footage but leaves out any information regarding the financial repercussions for BP. The only updates are regarding the dead and the two men who were shown in the film as being direct causes for the disaster. Unfortunately, the film does such a poor job of developing anyone other than Mike Williams, the death of the other characters are not felt at all, instead being reduced to background carnage. Seemingly recognizing this, Berg shows a montage at the end of the real men with their families. A touching moment, it does feel like a band-aid to make up for the fact that he only focused on one man for the whole film."", ""Thrilling, entertaining, and with tremendous sound editing and visual effects, Deepwater Horizon is a film that is a bit thin with regards to its writing, but never ceases to be a powerful and utterly compelling experience. That said, boy does it ever do justice to Mike Williams and his wife. Not to be disparaging, as I am the last one to criticize based on looks, but these people are not Mark Wahlberg and Kate Hudson. Not even close. Few are, but these people are just your average citizens, yet Berg casts Mark \""Muscles\"" Wahlberg and Kate \""Brad Pitt's New Girl\"" Hudson as them. I would be honored if I was the Williams family."" ]";5
993;little-men;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Little Men is a solid film from director Ira Sachs. A film about the friendship between two boys and how it becomes fractured due to a business dispute between their parents, the film feels real. At every turn, it feels like real life. These are real people and get authentic performances from good, down to earth actors. That said, Little Men is hardly perfect. Though it really captures the look and feel of Brooklyn and the surrounding community, in addition to its characters, it just feels so slight. It covers the topics of young male friendship, immaturity, and lack of understanding between parents and children, but it never does it in an acceptable depth. The film sort of appears, touches on these topics, and then disappears because it is far too short. That said, it does have moments of real resonance that stand out and make this a more than worthwhile experience."", ""Little Men introduces us to Tony Calvelli (Michael Barbieri) and Jake Jardine (Theo Taplitz). Following the death of Jake's grandfather, he and his parents move into his Brooklyn apartment and now own the store space below the apartment. Currently, the store is owned by Tony's mother, Leonor (Paulina Garcia). Unfortunately, she has been paying very little due to a favorable relationship with Brian Jardine's (Greg Kinnear) now deceased father. As Brian is a failing actor and his wife is the sole breadwinner for the family, he desperately needs to raise the lease amount. His sister also is pressuring him to do so, leading to friction with Leonor. This friction gets to the kids who, in an act of unity, refuse to talk to their parents. Yet, despite everyone's best intentions, the families are tragically driven apart."", ""It is in this relationship between the families that the film really soars. A lack of communication permeates this film and is what really drives them apart. People avoid confrontation or simply use muteness as a sign of disagreement. This really only exacerbates their problems, as little Jake soon realizes. In an emotional moment of the film, he has an outburst in front of everybody and apologizes to his dad for not talking to him and begs to understand why they are doing this to the Calvelli's. This outburst highlights the importance of communication (sometimes too much of it) and how it has led to the crumbling of relations between these two, once close, families.  On this note, however, the observations feel relatively mundane and overly slight. It never dives into them enough and what really makes these people tick. It adds elements - such as Jake likely being gay - to add depth to the characters and add to the realism, but much of it never really impacts the film or the characters in any meaningful way. While that is fine, it would have been nice if it had added to the themes explored in the film or even the overall disintegration of the relationships in the film."", ""That said, the friendship in the film between Jake and Tony is terrific. Willing to defend each other no matter what, the fast friends are solidly acted by the young actors. They can be loose around one another and express their hopes and dreams, without fear of judgment. They encourage one another from the start and can simply pal around and do whatever. Really a tenderly written friendship, this element of the film is one of the best parts of Little Men and why it deserves the acclaim it has received for the most part. Not too many films create such a delicate and tender look at teenage male friendships, yet this one does and its authenticity is astounding."", ""The film also introduces an important theme of masculinity. Brian Jardine is not really a man in the eyes of people like Leonor. Her husband is off in Africa being a nurse and she also views this as not manly enough, as he clearly does not provide. Yet, she really looks down on Brian, even telling him that his father thought the same and told her as much. Since Brian is a struggling actor, his psychotherapist wife is the breadwinner and pays for everything they own. Though Brian and his wife Kathy (Jennifer Ehle) are fine with the arrangement, the reversal of gender roles is  a tough issue for many to accept and even Brian struggles. You can see that there is something within him that is bothered by this arrangement and a conversation with Leonor really brings it to light. Unfortunately, like many other things in the film, it is introduced and then taken away far too soon."", ""Little Men is an incredibly slight film. It is too short for the amount of themes it wants to and it approaches those themes tepidly. While it is well acted, the film simply never really does nearly enough with its characters or its themes to be anything more than an above average film with the potential to be better. That said, as a business major, I do appreciate that Sachs took care to not demonize the Jardine family for kicking out Leonor and her business. It is a business decision, pure and simple. I would evict her too."" ]";5
994;florence-foster-jenkins;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Extremely safe and straight forward, this is certainly not up there with some of director Stephen Frears' more challenging works, but is a thoroughly enjoyable, sad, and funny film about a woman with a big heart who had a truly awful voice. Meryl Streep is very good in the lead role and Hugh Grant turns in a typically charismatic performance as her doting husband. Both have received Oscar buzz for their roles. Personally, I do not know if they were quite to that level, but you never know what the rest of the year will deliver. If either are nominated, they were certainly quite good, so it would not be totally unjustified. As for the film itself, the costume and make-up are terrific. However, the problems lie with Frears. Aside from its straight-forward nature, the film is sort of unbalanced. It wants us to sympathize with Florence and show how ruthlessly she was mocked and laughed at by those who did not know her. Yes, she was bad, but dammit she tried and poured her heart and soul into every note. It made her truly happy and filled her heart with joy. Who are we to mock that? Yet, then the film turns her bad singing into comedy, encouraging us to laugh at her with long, drawn out scenes of her singing with reaction shots of the rest of the cast to her singing. These scenes are hysterical, but man oh man, does it not gel with us sympathizing with her. Are we to feel bad for Florence or just join the chorus of laughter? I have to imagine Frears wanted us to feel for her, but fails in this endeavor as the film plays more along the lines of a comedy than anything else. While it was funny, do not get me wrong, it could have been a far more powerful film if it did not simply play into cheap laughs at this poor woman's expense. Overall, Florence Foster Jenkins is a pretty, well-acted film that simply cannot decide what it wanted to try to do."" ]";5

For if it were not for Warrior, he would be one of the most bland and consistently average directors working in Hollywood today. His resume is also bolstered when viewed alongside that of Peter Berg or David Ayer. That said, The Accountant is just fine. It is a modern day action thriller that screams of O'Connor having finished a viewing of Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive and thought to himself, \""What if the whole movie had the level of tension of the opening heist in that film and my autistic assassin actually talked a bit?\"" The end result is The Accountant, a film that passes the test and delivers good entertainment, but is hardly brilliant and is maligned by major problems. In essence, this is not a film requiring a forensic accountant. Anybody can plainly see the faults lying beneath the heart of this film."", ""To the film's credit, however, it is incredibly thrilling. The action is modern and stylish. It is silent, precise, and well-choreographed. Ben Affleck's Christian Wolff is autistic and a savant when it comes to accounting and putting a bullet between a man's eyes. As a result, the kills are thrilling and simply cool. For action junkies or the general public that is merely looking for a good action thriller, The Accountant more than delivers. It is no surprise it has become a champion of the people and made a lot of money at the box office. For a bloody action thriller, it is palatable and easy to digest. It does not entertain a higher purpose beyond advocating for people with autism. It is smart, well-plotted, and delivers the goods when it comes to action and thrills. O'Connor may not be a good director, but he knows his way around an action sequence and shows it here. With constant one-liners and a distant hero that is against the system, comparisons to old school 1980s action movies are incredibly fair. Wolff goes about his business professionally and without fanfare. It is all a matter of fact. He is an easy killer to support because he kills bad men out for themselves, while seeking revenge for those they harm. In essence, he fights for the common man, real salt of the Earth people, and loves his family. The only thing separating him from the average American is he has autism and kills people with precision."", ""Sadly, the film is maligned with odd transactions. To the film's debit, it is incredibly contrived. Introducing us to federal agent Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), she is threatened with being thrown into jail for lying on her applicatio if she does not find the accountant's true identity within a month by boss Raymond King (J.K. Simmons). Throughout the film, we see her figure out information on Wolff, following mere plot coincidences and contrivances. The most egregious being when she is searching for men that fit her suspect's description and randomly selects a man who does not meet the description, looks into his business, and all the businesses in the same plaza. Slowly, she realizes it is her man: the accountant. How convenient. With no evidence pointing to that fact until the hand of God guides her down the right path, Medina find her man. But oh wait, she did not need to. King knew it all because he had been in contact with the accountant forever, tracked him before, and could seemingly care less who he is and what he does, in spite of pretending to care earlier in the film. It is as if O'Connor changed his mind halfway through and decided that King should work with Wolff, not against him. Ignoring how cliche that is, it is a convenient way to avoid conflict between the government and Wolff, which would make him a bad guy in the eyes of the same general public audience the film was trying to appeal to throughout. Sadly, the fact that the investigation by Medina was pointless, all of the treasury department scenes are useless. Neither King nor Medina add anything to the film beyond another character and supposed depth. In reality, it is bloat, highlighting how overlong this mindless action thriller truly is."", ""The film punishes the audience further with useless melodrama and backstory on Christian. Used to show how good of a person he is and how important family is to him, the scenes honestly go nowhere. From his mother's funeral, training, and reuniting with his brother, the whole thing is so contrived and oddly manipulative. Once more, it contributes to the film's bloat, not adding depth. The scenes feel useless and exposition heavy for a film that demonstrates its willingness to use its typically silent protagonist as an exposition machine when the plot demands some explanation. Sadly, despite all the bloat, O'Connor never found a use for Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick). Why get Anna Kendrick if all she is there for is to look good and say some bad lines that are going to be used in the trailer? She never even kisses Affleck in the film."" ]";5

Highlighting the struggles they face together as black men living in Germany, as well as having lost their wife/mother, the film really soars when they bond. Though the film never satisfactorily dives into the emotional drama enough with the deceased wife/mother, the film does show some good father-son bonding. Here, the film winds up being deeply affecting, particularly in the final sequence when Curtis begs Morris to be on his team and not continue causing problems for him. Of the entire film, the writing is strongest in this area."", ""However, the second strongest area of the film is Morris' relationship with Katrin (Lina Keller).

Not only does he gain the confidence to become a rapper, but he learns to go with the flow and experience new things. Above all, even if he does not yet realize it, he learned a lot about German culture and took a step toward adjusting to his new homeland."", ""That said, the film does struggle at times with its comedy.

Since I hate cringe comedy, this does not work for me too much. In particular, the scene when Morris \""raps\"" and then gets kicked out of the youth center really caused me physical pain. I can only imagine it was intended to be comedic since it was so poorly put together and really just caused me to look away from the screen. This was hardly the only scene where I had to cover my eyes, unfortunately."", ""Additionally, the film's characterization of Katrin left a lot to be desired. As is usual, we are left looking at her character negatively even though Morris is the one who obsessed about her and just assumed she would be into him. In fairness, she dropped a lot of hints (even asking him if it is true what people say about black guys and their...members), but she equally owed him nothing. Even worse, he is the one who assaulted her boyfriend when he got mad and decided to fight over Katrin. Really, if anybody misstepped in this relationship, it is certainly Morris, which is why it is unfortunate to see her painted negatively to the audience."", ""All-in-all, Morris from America never really provides satisfactory looks at certain emotional elements and its entertainment is quite fleeting.

Telling the true story about the men responsible for the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, third-in-command for the Nazis, the film is clearly powerful. An undertold story of the strength of the Czechoslovakian resistance and an obviously important moment in World War II, Operation Anthropoid receives its due regards in this film from director Sean Ellis. Unfortunately, it is a mixed bag. While it has terrific cinematography, good acting, and a tremendous assassination, the latter comes too early and the film loses steam. Of course, the cliched beginning with a love triangle and the cliched WWII action sequence at the end also hinder the game. That said, the assassination is so damn good."", ""Starring Cillian Murphy and Jamie Dornan as the men responsible for the assassination, Anthropoid's greatest asset is the assassination sequence. As most people should know (I ashamedly did not), they were successful to a degree. It is likely that Sean Ellis assumed building up to such a well known event would not be suspenseful enough. However, he is shown to be wrong. In the first half of this film, the build up, the planning, and the anxiety of the situation are terrifically captured. The following nervy, thrilling, and suspenseful assassination is tremendously captured. Ellis' camera makes the occasion incredibly intimate with a cloud of smoke billowing out of the area in the aftermath. The intensity of the lead up and the panic of the moments directly after is incredibly effective in setting the moment and capturing it with beautiful images and a tremendous action sequence. Rather than playing into cliches here, the film sets it apart with a unique, intense, and unexpected moment of brilliance. It also makes me want to see Jamie Dornan in a neo-noir film set in the 1940s. The suit and fedora look is just so right for him."", ""The other strength of this film is the cinematography and production design. Shot through a sepia filter, the film looks old school and, in conjunction with the sets and locations, looks and feels authentic. Anthropoid really captures 1942 Czechoslovakia and turns it into a beautiful painting. To bolster this, Ellis sprinkles in some absolutely gorgeous shots. These include shots of the sun spilling through the sees in a forest and an aerial shot a bridge in Prague and sun reflecting off the water and the rays going under the bridge. With these shots and the general aesthetic under its belt, WWII Czechoslovakia has never looked so good and Ellis makes sure to capture this beauty."", ""Unfortunately, its love triangle and cliched second half derail the film. With boring scenes of torture and a lackluster finale shootout in a church, Anthropoid turns into nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action thriller. The power that this really happened does not help as numerous true stories have shown the exact same action. This bad ending is proof that the assassination came too soon. It should have been the climax instead. The film would have been more detailed and a lot slower for sure, but its ending would have been worthy of the heroism on display. It is the moment that sets its heroes apart. Instead of ending there, however, Ellis' film drags on for a cliched final hour that turns them into nothing more than soldiers in a World War II film. Their identities are forgotten with writing that failed to create worthwhile characters that are memorable. They may die in a hail of bullets, but the film was killed long before. Now, I should say that the action sequence is fine. It looks good and is pretty thrilling, but there are too many films with it that pretend to be WWII thrillers. This sea of bullets turns it into nothing more than a cliched film with no element to separate it from similar films."", ""Tremendously shot with a great assassination sequence, Anthropoid may be pretty, but it is nothing but above average. The ending is cliched, the characters underdeveloped, and the romance ill-advised. That said, the strengths of the film are so incredible, Anthropoid is impossible to look past."" ]";5

It may be a touch heavy-handed at times with its anti-bank mentality, but this is more than overcome by its terrifically crafted characters. The brothers are very multi-dimensional, as though they may be criminals, we feel for them deeply because of their circumstances and hope they can get away with it all. That said, even the cops are well developed. Bridges' character and his relationship with Gil Birmingam's character is terrific. Not only is their banter hysterical, but for friends and fellow cops, they are given a shocking amount of depth. In addition to its terrific writing, Hell or High Water is a sturdy film that defies expectations, as is tradition with David Mackenzie's films. He takes typical premises and more than just spruces them up. Instead, he reinvents it and turns it into a fully nuanced and powerful film that explores family relationships and how far you will go to help your family. Even more, it explores the violent nature of man and how thin the line between life and death is and can be. The film's cinematography is also terrific with some seriously beautiful shots strewn through this film. Not only did it capture the Southern aesthetic as previously mentioned, it really captured the look and feel of the towns it was set in.

As with most of his films, it is certainly laced with witty dialogue, fun characters, and great acting. Led by Eisenberg, he once more shows that he has terrific chemistry with Kristen Stewart. At this point, the duo is like the less attractive, less charismatic version of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone with the frequency of their collaborations. The rest of the cast is quite good as well, especially Steve Carell and Blake Lively. Additionally, the cinematography is phenomenal and gives the film this dreamlike atmosphere that perfectly captures the similarities (despite perceived differences) between Los Angeles and New York. As always, Woody Allen is still witty and great at creating realistic and touching romances, while blending in religion and social commentary.

Its actions are slow and drawn out. This allows White to inject the film with incredible tension and, occasionally, a unique visual style. Throughout the film, much of the film has this very sleek, glowing look that establishes Our Kind of Traitor as both a good looking film and a decidedly modern one. At times, however, it can be extremely distracting. For example, there is one scene in which McGregor is sitting and is overtaken by a bright orange lens flare that obscures our view of him. I can only hope that was unintentional."", ""Yet, even when that occurs, the film is incredibly well-written. Tense, deliberate, and with a ton of moving parts, Our Kind of Traitor is a Le Carre spy adaptation, through and through. It is very subtle and a lot happens that the film simply expects  the audience to keep up with it. Fortunately, if you are paying attention, this is hardly a challenge and it is very rewarding to watch a film that trusts its audience to keep up and does not feel the need to spell everything out."", ""The acting in Our Kind of Traitor is also tremendous. McGregor is terrific in the lead role, as the unsuspecting and personally maligned college professor who gets thrown into international politics. Skarsgard, as the repentant and family-focused member of the Russian mafia, is boisterous and loud when needed, but equally solemn and subtle when things turn serious. The balance he strikes between these two personalities is quite compelling to watch and never a let down. As the stolid MI6 agent, Damian Lewis is pretty stereotypical, but brought a cold, calculating edge to the role that really made his performance incredibly captivating."", ""In a world of action spy films dominated by James Bond and Ethan Hunt, John Le Carre spy films are a breath of fresh air every time. Even if Our Kind of Traitor is not the best film of the recent bunch, it is still a terrific spy film that is thrilling, engaging, and smart.

1001;complete-unknown;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Far too low-key to be anything incredible, Complete Unknown appears to have been quite divisive amongst critics, while entirely despised by audiences (27%! on Rotten Tomatoes from the audience right now). For me, I am apparently one of the few who actually found Complete Unknown to be entirely riveting. Far from a conventional mystery, Complete Unknown tells the story of a woman, Alice (Rachel Weisz), and her reunion with her old boyfriend Tom (Michael Shannon). Having gone 15 years without contact after Alice (then Jenny) dropped off the face of the Earth, Complete Unknown is a film whose mystery is not a crime. Rather, its mystery is who is Alice? What is her past?"", """", ""A woman who cycles through identities whenever bored, Alice could be written off as merely yet another unlikable protagonist. Yet, it is in fact a story of transformation. For Alice, a woman who is deeply unhappy in her own skin, changing her identity and location grants her a new lease on life. Yes, she burns bridges and many write her off as a pathological liar, but at the center of her is a woman looking to find herself and where she truly belongs. Having tried a buffet of personalities and careers, the film manages to actually be quite harrowing as a character study into this troubled woman. Initially, we - much like the supporting cast - despise her and are confused about why she is lying left and right. It is only later that we realize this is not merely some mystery thriller about a mysterious woman. Rather, it is a tragedy. It is a tragedy about somebody searching for themselves and failing to come up with a suitable answer."", """", ""it is for this very reason that the ending is what it is and also why many reject this film. Audiences demand clarity and satisfaction from an ending. Complete Unknown leaves more questions than answers. Though the ending sequence is brilliant with a terrific use of focus racking from director Joshua Marston to visually show us Alice transforming and starting anew, it is far from gratifying as a viewer. This may not bother me personally, but many will find fault with this type of conclusion. Yet, what more can be asked of a woman who frequently drops her life and leaves without a trace? Much like the other characters, they are left with no answers and clueless as to who and where she will be next."", """", ""Though an incredibly short film, Complete Unknown develops Alice's character incredibly well, while also doing a good job developing the character of Tom. A disenchanted man who feels himself failing at a job that provides no rewards, his wife - Ramina (Azita Ghanizada) - is set to head to jewelry school across the country. Yet, he is uncertain whether he wants to stay at his dead end job or follow his apparently dead end marriage to California. Similarly to Alice's story, the audience is left not knowing what will happen to Tom. However, this really adds to the mystery and the discussion. For both of our characters, their lives are wholly unsatisfactory. Though in different ways, both are still trying to find themselves and identify what they are meant to be doing in life. This is not something that can be concluded in a film, nor are there any answers that our characters have as of yet. It is here that Complete Unknown is elevated from unremarkable indie film to a thoroughly compelling film that deserves to have an audience."", """", ""Featuring good lead performances from Rachel Weisz and Michael Shannon as always, Complete Unknown is an unpredictable and unsatisfactory experience. Those searching for clarity will find none and left hating the film. Those willing to go along with the film and embrace the mystery of life will find that what the film lacks in answers, it more than makes up for it an expertly crafted character study about two tragic figures on the path to nowhere."" ]";5

This game asks new sign-ups to either be a watcher or a player. Watchers, well, watch. Players are tasked with dares they must complete for serious cash prizes (one such dare rewards $15,000!) depending on the challenge of the dare. Often dangerous, death-defying, illegal, or simply incredibly awkward, the dares increase in difficulty along the way, putting our characters in serious harm. A comment on the culture of anonymity on the internet, Nerve is a fast-paced, fun, and certainly important film that reaches the target demographic incredibly effectively."", ""With all of today's top 100 pop songs as its playlist, as well as incredible usage of technology such as facetime/skype, Facebook, computers, and texting, Nerve is a film aimed at teenagers. However, it is adorned with an authenticity that makes it feel real. It is a film for millennials by millennials. As such, a lot of teenage lingo is included and will likely leave older viewers feeling old. Yet, this hyper, knowledge at your fingertips culture does have a truly positive impact on the film, as it is a very quickly paced movie. Things accelerate quickly and the film races alongside its characters with odd amounts of ease, as it never loses itself or becomes too quick. Instead, its hyper speed really matches the modern society incredibly well, allowing the film to be a great parallel of the 21st century and put it in prime position to critique our world."", ""And critique it certainly does. Highlighting the risks behind internet anonymity, internet game trends, cyber bullying, and peer pressure, Nerve is certainly a film of the moment. In particular, the climax of the film really highlights all of these dangers and shows the lengths our society has been driven to, as a result of being able to hide behind a screen. Though the ending may be in your face, it certainly has to be, given its target. As us millennials are likely staring at our phones, Nerve knows it needs to spell out its message and it certainly does this. However, this force feeding does not undermine the grace or execution of this message. Rather, it only furthers its urgency. In many ways, the climax parallels something out of Ancient Rome or lines Maximus would and did scream out at the crowd in Ridley Scott's Gladiator. Should our society not stop hiding behind a screen, which allows us to commit atrocities, there is certainly a chance we end up like Rome and Nerve recognizes this threat. If the person on the other side of the computer stops being seen as a human by the user, our society is doomed and Nerve is an urgent call to wake up before it is too late."", ""This said, Nerve is hardly all message. Rather, it is still an energetic film without its message and could be categorized as a teen romance to some. The definition of teenage romance with 25-year old Emma Roberts starring as Vee who meets another \""player\"", 31-year old Dave Franco who plays the risky daredevil Ian/Sam. In all seriousness, both Roberts and Franco turn in very good performances with terrific chemistry. Though relying upon teenage movie cliches, the duo are really well fleshed out and their characters' chemistry is very good. While some may say that Vee certainly turned on a dime from the beginning to the risk-taker she was at the end, it does feel plausible to me, given Ian/Sam's personality. A risk-taker who Vee was immediately captivated by, she essentially felt the need to play catch-up and fed off of his energy, rather than making a change in her own personality. Rather than changing, she was merely emulating the actions of the man she fell for. That said, these characters are hardly perfect. With useless back stories and supporting characters that are really not that well fleshed out beyond cliches (the friend-zoned hacker guy friend, the slutty best friend, and the Asian friend)."", ""Yet, Nerve makes up what it loses in characters with #aesthetic. One may claim there is too much neon in this movie. In fact, it overwhelms one shot towards the beginning. Though it often mirrors reality, Nerve it felt the need to make it almost dream-like or Nicolas Winding Refn movie-esque with every light swapped out for the neon equivalent. With glowing blues, pinks, and yellows, Nerve is one neon-filled film. And I loved it. There is no such thing as too much neon. The one could be one huge lens flare of neon that obscured the entire plot and I would have been completely satisfied. There may be a day where a film comes out with too much neon, but Nerve is not that film. Rather, it creates an oddly surreal looking world that just looks absolutely terrific. Set against the dark gray buildings of New York City, the color palette here really pops."" ]";5

The entire cast is more than able in this little indie film about a man and his kids who live in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. An incredibly philosophical film about child rearing, acceptance, and balance, the film is incredibly well-written with its characters carrying a considerable amount of nuance.

Sandberg does it with ease in this scare-filled, chilling, and atmospheric horror film. Never knowing where the attack will come from next, Sandberg's horror instincts are top-notch, but what is even better is the story. Far too often, horror movies ditch the story in favor of just trying to scare its audience. However, Lights Out develops its characters, it story, and really earns it scares and horror. At the end of the day, it is as divisive as all other horror movies, but it has an undeniably great concept and, for me, it executed this concept perfectly."", ""Starring Diana as our resident evil being, this poor family has been stalked and hunted by Diana for a long, long time. Though impeccably scary, her back story and her connection to this family are incredibly well-developed and compelling. Sandberg, in this case, turns the film almost into an investigative drama as Rebecca (Teresa Palmer), her little brother Martin (Gabriel Bateman), and her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia), piece together who Diana is and her relation to Rebecca and Martin's mom, Sophie (Maria Bello). In this section, Sandberg manages to create tension through the mystery of the entire proceeding and invites the audience to solve the mystery along with the characters, which is always a fun enterprise to undertake as an audience member."", ""However, the real point here is to scare you. Though cliched in parts, the film's unique concept allows the film to take a unique approach to these cliches and always keeps you guessing throughout the runtime. Along with the characters, we are forced to guess where Diana is and, as her movement is hard to pinpoint, you can never really guess where she is hiding. Sandberg definitely has a lot of fun getting his character's and audience's mind racing with this element and uses it in order to buck cliches."", ""In terms of its characters, all of them are largely well developed. However, all are bolstered by their actor. Particularly, Palmer is terrific as Rebecca and really steals the show. Along the same lines, Bello perfectly portrays the tormented Sophie who cannot escape the clutches of Diana, no matter how hard she tries. Though you can see the ending coming, its power is bolstered by the acting of this duo who allow the film to reach a terrific emotional and horror crescendo."", ""For a horror film, Lights Out is terrific. For a debut, it is all the more impressive. With great creature design, mythology, story, and characters, Lights Out is clearly a labor of love for Sandberg and it really pays off in this chilling, thrilling, and downright scary film that made me regret leaving the lights off when watching."" ]";5

Yes, it does cover too much. Yes, interspersing scenes from the future kills the flow of the plot, even if it continues the thematic elements of the film. Yes, it probably does simplify more than a few things. All that said, I still really liked this film."", """", ""As I greatly enjoy history and have long craved a new film about the Civil War, I was just about to accept any drivel to make me truly satisfied. Fortunately, this one fits the bill and is slightly better than drivel. Matthew McConaughey turns in a typically charismatic and cool performance as a man I would follow to the end of the Earth and jump through a brick wall if he told me to. Not even as Newton Knight, either. I would jump off a bridge if McConaughey told me to without regret or shame."", """", ""A sprawling and ambitious attempt to not only cover the story of Newton Knight, but also the period just before and right after the end of the Civil War in the South including topics such as apprenticeship, the rise of the KKK, inter-racial love, voting, literacy, \""emancipation\"", and reconstruction. This often untold area of the Civil War is told very well in Free State of Jones, even if its jumping through time a bit is a clunky way of approaching the topics. That said, each scene it does show covers the topics it sets out to cover very well and accomplishes its main goal: to inform. Even better, it not just informs, but it entertains with tense and well-constructed action sequences that capture the look and feel of the Civil War. If nothing else, Gary Ross did his homework and that is truly admirable."", """", ""Though the general plots expansiveness could have been better handled, Ross does a great job balancing his characters. Focusing in one people from different worlds, he does a good job developing the major players, especially Knight (McConaughey), Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), and Moses (Mahershala Ali). These characters really have good chemistry with one another and are largely well-written."", """", ""The production design and costume design is another major win for Free State of Jones. With shocking attention to detail from the swamps of Mississippi to the battlefield, the film is masterfully crafted. The costume design for the uniforms and clothing is terrific and really impressive with its period detail. This, in addition to the characters, is where the film's bread and butter can really be found. Ross' ability to create well-developed characters and attention to detail is really evident in these two areas and why I found the film to be better than expected."", """", ""On the negative side, Free State of Jones' use of the future case does further its examination of the power of prejudice. I mean, Newton's great-great-great grandson looks white, yet the fact that Newton had a child with Rachel means that he cannot marry the white woman he is in love with. Many took issue with the film supposedly mirroring the struggle of blacks with those of whites, but to me, it is not doing that. Instead, it is showcasing how deep and far this prejudice go. For all intents and purposes his great-great-great grandson is white. Yet, in the chance he any black in him, he must go to jail for trying to marry a white woman. Incredible stuff that shows how deeply hatred runs. Unfortunately, Ross has no idea how to work this into the film and the scenes play far too briefly and with little emotional impact. Instead, they are like blips that break up the rest of the film."", """", ""Overall, Matthew McConaughey is very good in this film destined to be shown in history classes across the nation. An untold story from the Civil War, the story of Newton Knight and Jones County is an inspirational one of fighting for what you believe in. Though it is a bit long and could have been told better, the acting, characters, and production/costume design more than elevate this one in a well told history film. Above all, I am more than willing to accept this film to try and fill my craving for more historically-based films, especially ones from the Civil War."" ]";5

While I admit that Blake Lively knows how to wear a bikini, this is certainly not the focal point as she proves doubters wrong by kicking ass from beginning to end. Director Jaume Collet-Serra does a good job creating well crafted thrills, instead of relying on cheap jump scares and like. Instead, a chilly atmosphere and sense of permeating dread is a constant presence in the film. However, Lively takes center stage here as pretty much the only actor we encounter (aside from a few brief side characters). Though she had not done much to inspire hope as an actress with this much screen time, she knocks it out of the park. While not award winning by any means, her performance is quite good and hints at some untapped potential. Additionally, the cinematography is breath taking, resulting in one of the prettiest end credits I have ever seen. Though, from beginning to end, the film has a fantastic look and feel that maximizes on the fantastic setting, even when things turn dire. Overall, The Shallows is not the best film of the year by any means, but is is perfect summertime counter programming. Entertaining, thrilling, and well made, The Shallows delivers."" ]";5

It is no surprise that the film has received accolades for this, as the film's animations and little visual effect tricks are impeccable. As Kubo tells his stories and the papers begin to replicate characters, the visual impact is impeccable and a true testament to the hard work put in by the animators. The cinematography is also breathtaking with the film using the sun and the trees to create a very natural beauty for a film that occurs in such mystical terms. That said, it is not as funny or as adventurous as its animated counterparts and it is this missing element that leaves Kubo and the Two Strings as a good film, but not one that is very good or great."", ""With terrific voice acting from Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Ralph Fiennes, and Rooney Mara, the film sets up a conflict between the Moon King (Fiennes) and Kubo (Parkinson). Kubo, a young boy with magical powers from his mother, is the grandson of the Moon King. However, the Moon King is blind to the world and its pain and desires. He is cold and unwelcoming and wants Kubo to be the same way, so he takes one of his eyes. He tries to take the other, but his mother and father take him away. However, his father is killed, leaving him alone with his magical mother, Sariatu (Theron). Accompanied by his mother as a monkey (it makes sense) and Beetle (Matthew McConaughey), Kubo embarks on a journey to find his father's armor in order to defeat the Moon King. What ensues is a film with great mythology, but is far too predictable. It is a kids movie, yes, but I do not mean the plot. The various little twists are ear marked from the beginning and, yet, the film treats them as if they are incredible and totally unforeseen. This is a shame because the film could have moved through some of these elements quicker and not just relied upon them for surprises."", ""That said, the film's mythology and use of magic is incredible. Not only is it beautifully animated in this regard, but it always instills a sense of awe and incredible power that, for young kids, will make them want to run out and pretend to be Kubo. This is a terrific trait for an animated film aimed at kids and it is one this film has in bunches. It is an incredibly imaginative film that also serves as an introduction to Asian culture and beliefs regarding death and the connection between man and nature. Again, these sequences are brilliantly brought to life, but have even more power in the meaning of these moments and the weight with which it is communicated. This is a film with a deep respect for Asian culture and it shows."", ""Comedically, the film is strongest when Beetle is on the screen. All animated movies must infuse comedy to keep kids engaged and this one is no exception. McConaughey delivers the comedic lines brilliantly and the film drags a bit when he is off the screen. Beetle really gives the film the comedic energy and urgency it desperately needs. On that note, the film can somewhat slack off at times, losing the sense of adventure and pace demanded by its target audience. The film may miss the mark in entertaining children for this reason as the film's comedic introductions are not frequent enough and its story can take a bit too long to reveal itself."", ""More problematically, it is interesting to see this film be let off the hook for its casting. Sure, pile on The Great Wall where Matt Damon plays a white character from Europe that just happens to be in China, but let this one off the hook. All of these characters are voiced by white actors and all of the characters are Asian. This is not something I would detract from the film rating-wise, but how this one escaped controversy is very odd. There are enough good, talented Asian actors that could have fulfilled these roles, so it is a shame to see the film rely on talented, but white actors instead. Shocking that those who are more cognizant of these issues did not raise these concerns regarding these film."", ""That said, the film is impeccably animated with phenomenal visual effects. Its embracing of its mythology and Asian culture is incredible and often quite powerful to watch unfold. That said, its plot \""twists\"" are too obvious and the film can drag in parts, while never utilizing its strong supporting cast enough in comparison to the quality they bring to this film.

As with the original, The Conjuring 2 has a lot going for it. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga have terrific chemistry and make for a truly believable married couple who happen to fight demonic presences in homes. Plus, this new story - particularly the nun - made me produce more than a few bricks out of fear. The slow introduction of the presence and then the rising actions of its presence is great. The film is willing to build tension in a horror movie sense while then balancing it with the tension of whether or not everyone will believe the family. Most horror movies just want to skip into everything and just assumes everyone believes in ghosts. However, Wan knows he has skeptics in the crowd and must prove his case in order to scare them as well. This said, there is one major problem with The Conjuring 2 that holds it back; the ending. In order to defeat the demon, Lorraine must use its name against it. How does she know its name? Oh, it told her earlier in the movie. If the name gives humans power over the demon, why would the demon ever give up its name? I like to imagine that this demon was fired as Chief Possession Officer in England after such a rookie mistake. That said, The Conjuring 2 keeps you on edge for the entire film and effectively earns its scares, instead of relying on cheap tricks. Heck, even the jump scares are well earned, merely through the tension and atmosphere Wan creates. Though a minor stepback, The Conjuring 2 takes what made the original terrific horror and repackages it for another story."" ]";5

Incendies, Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, and now Arrival are all some of the best films of this decade - no, century - and each has an indelible respect for the audience. It trusts that we will follow along as Villeneuve spins a web that, though it may not make sense initially, will craft a gorgeous vignette of some element of existence. Arrival is most certainly a part of this collection now and is one of the best science fiction films in a while with stunning visuals, chill-inducing brilliance, and incredible performances."", ""Admittedly, however, Arrival missed the mark for the first half or so. It seemed so different. So unique. Nothing truly made sense from the opening with this daughter that seems out of place for the film I expected to receive, plus the weird narration scene by Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). It just seemed so haphazardly put together that it seemed wholly indigestible. However, after this halfway point, the film is pure brilliance. Even better, it opens up the world of the first half to the point that you realize that - even if the narration is still a moment that I cannot wrap my head around -  everything else adds up. In this second half, Arrival soars with the grace and beauty previously only experienced by eagles."", ""A confusing, nonlinear film, Arrival follows Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the country's best linguist in the aftermath of the arrival of extraterrestrials. In the interest of determining their purpose, Louise is tasked with cracking the code of the heptapods (the aliens). What transpires is film that can often mirror Dances with Wolves in its respect for language (Close Encounters of the Third Kind as well to a degree for this) and Contact for its similarities regarding the military and its approach to, again, language. In many respects, Arrival is a science fiction film, but it is also a film about destiny, free-will, and the beauty of language."", ""Through language, worlds open up. One can weave a beautiful sentence that can move readers to tears. Others can craft a speech that sways people to believe one thing or the other. Language allows people to express feelings, emotions, thoughts, or simply converse with others. Language, as discussed in the film, is the foundation of a civilization. In many ways, it is the foundation of humanity. Arrival delves into this sheer beauty of language throughout the picture. Villeneuve brilliantly allows this elegance to take centerstage with long drawn out sequences of nothing but communication between Louise and the heptapods."", ""Yet, the film hardly stops there. Through showing the possibilities the language of the heptapods can reveal, Arrival hits a peak. Once we learn that the heptapods language allows the speaker to see the future, Arrival's philosophical explorations really take hold. This is the part where many will be lost and why I am skeptical as to film's acceptance amongst general audiences. However, the film's nonlinear storytelling is incredibly revealing and really works. Through the nonlinear storytelling, we know the end of Louise's story. We do not know that we know this, but by the end, it is clear what her future is. Louise knows it and though she keeps it to herself in the present, we know the future is something that is simulatenously her past. It is already a part of her and one she cannot escape. However, it is clear she does not wish to escape her future. It is one filled with challenges, but filled with equal joy and love. Films have previously discussed the concepts of free-will and destiny (hell, Oedipus did this in the BC's) and yet, Arrival brings a warmth to the discussion. Though Louise may know her future, she chooses to head into it with no hesitation. Yes, it will bring her unspeakable pain and tragedy, but it will also bring sheer ecstasy. For Louise and many others, this is more than acceptable. However, Arrival does not hesitate to ask: If you know your future, would you try to change it? This is certainly a fallacy, as I believe Arrival showcases. The heptapods knew Louise's future. How? Because it already happened. There is no time, there is no free-will, there is only destiny. For the world of Arrival, the possibilities of the world are not endless. You are on a path and destined to complete this path."", ""Arrival often mirrors the language it discusses, not just the heptapods' language, though. Language, as Louise states frequently, can be messy and confusing. Yet, it opens doors to the world that were previously locked tight. This is very similar to the film as a whole, as it is a complex puzzle and my initial hesitation to the film's world was because I only received small pieces of a large puzzle. Once they started fitting together and the image became clearer, the film became a truly awe-inspiring, striking, and beautiful experience."" ]";5

Undeniably a horror film, The Neon Demon leaves you cool and numb in the wake of its disturbing images of the industry. Refn expertly creates a parallel between the industry and what is portrayed on the screen, eliciting brilliant criticism on the industry and the way in which it destroys young girls, as well as the way in which these girls are victimized and corrupted along the way. Elle Fanning plays the lead role brilliantly, as the innocent, yet decidedly dangerously beautiful Jesse. The dialogue here is terrific, far surpassing many other films from the Danish director. The score from Cliff Martinez is filled with these synthy, creepy vibes that really wrap its tentacles around you and perfectly accent what is on the screen. The cinematography is incredible. From very cool mirror shots to lush looks at Los Angeles, the camera soaks in the neon goodness and is an absolute wonder. I cannot praise The Neon Demon enough. This illuminati-esque, hypnotic, and thoroughly violent and disturbing film from Nicolas Winding Refn could very well be categorized as a masterpiece."" ]";5

The quips can be funny, but the comedic timing is dreadful and undermines potentially serious moments. Even worse, I f***king hate Iron Man. I hated him before this movie. I hate him now and he's like half the movie. The Iron Man movies are the only Marvel ones I do not like and it is because of how much of a whiny, self-righteous brat his character is that I truly despise him. This ultimately hurt here and made the overall film incredibly underwhelming. That said, the new character introductions are appropriately epic and done very well. The film is incredibly entertaining with good fight scenes (minus the disorientation), it is funny, and the disagreement is very well laid out as opposed to the film about the sons of Marthas. The acting is more than acceptable here and thoroughly feels like a comic book movie. Overall, after enjoying the first two Captain America's, Civil War was wholly underwhelming due to Iron Man and being overstuffed with characters (who are referred to by their real name and superhero name interchangeably).

Plus, she is well matched here by Ethan Hawke who plays a self-absorbed and unethical man that seemingly cannot control his sexual urges. Julianne Moore, however, steals the show as his foreign and experienced wife. Together, these actors help bring to life this charming, heartbreaking, and thoroughly relatable tale of love and marriage. Though quite the typical indie dramedy, writer/director Rebecca Miller breathes some new life into its conventions with this thoroughly odd and off-kilter story, plus conjuring great chemistry between her actors.

Well paced and well-crafted, The Nice Guys has incredibly multi-dimensional characters and the film as a whole really pays homage to a bygone era, especially in Los Angeles. I am an absolute sucker for these neo-noir films set in Los Angeles, especially ones with fantastic cinematography and The Nice Guys most certainly fits the bill. Undoubtedly set to go down as one of the funniest films of 2016, The Nice Guys is not just some brain dead comedy.

The film can be over-the-top gory, yet it feels so horrific and horrifying, it is impossible to look away even for a weakling like myself."", """", ""Bathed in neon and blessed with a synth score, Baskin often feels like a film by Nicolas Winding Refn if he made is a straight horror film. Thoroughly style over substance, Baskin's plot is all over the place with dream sequences, flashbacks, flash forwards, and a thoroughly mindbending ending. This arthouse horror film from Turkey is one infused with style in large due to the aforementioned score that keeps on edge, but also the camera work. The film, often flush with neon highlights, is lavishly shot and the camera just seems to glide effortlessly and angelically through this hell local, allowing us to soak up every gruesome detail of Hell (located in an abandoned police station)."", """", ""Often quite hard to watch due to the violence that ensues, the most violent moments still remain ever watchable in large due to the acting performance of Mehmet Cerrahoglu. A mesmerizing sadistic and thoroughly evil performance, his role as \""The Father\"" features some of the most chilling dialogue the film has to offer, along with some of the best delivery. In a film packed with solid performances, Cerrahoglu absolutely steals centerstage as the short, yet towering figure who is worshipped as a God in this hellish landscape. His power and presence is unrivaled in the film and makes the sequences that much scarier."", """", ""Incredibly cerebral, Baskin is a true blend of gore and mindbending psychological thrillers. I have no idea what Baskin was trying to say, but it was a thoroughly confusing affair that (obviously) had some religious ticks, but was also completely focused on the ideas of fate and destiny. For those in the film, it was fate that they wound up in Hell and they had a purpose for being there. They had an importance and a purpose, which required them to wind up in this situation. However, even then, they had a fate that could not be avoided, which is showcased at the very end."", """", ""A truly hypnotic viewing experience, Baskin is a chilling and horrifying horror film from director Can Evrenol that certainly makes him a man worth keeping an eye on. Mindbending, thought-provoking, and lavishly shot, Baskin is such a pretty looking film, it is often hard to look away even when things get really gory. That said, it does get really gory. Though I am not a fan of gore, it certainly feels entirely secondary to Evrenol's philosophical musings and beautifully gliding camera work."" ]";5
1015;born-to-be-blue;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Far from your typical musical biopic, Born to Be Blue tells the tragic tale of jazz legend Chet Baker. Plagued with heroin addiction, but blessed with a musical gift, Baker is a truly tragic figure brought to life by Ethan Hawke. With a knack for telling a quality story that adequately blends Baker's earlier days with the beginning of his resurgence, Born to Be Blue manages to feel wholly unique in its biographical approach to a story that is largely pretty typical in the musical biopic subgenre."", """", ""In all of these films, a talented musician cheats on his women and does drugs to the point of being a hopeless addict. Scenes of adultery and drug use are juxtaposed with that musician turning in tremendous performance after tremendous performance. The end result is a heart wrenching look at the marriage of abuse and talent. Born to Be Blue touches on a lot of these same notes, but is largely quite unique. With flashbacks taken from a film about his own life done by Baker (Hawke) put shoulder-to-shoulder with scenes from the \""modern\"" day of Baker making his comeback, the film's narrative never feels stale. Instead, its focus on his drug abuse feels largely in-reflection as he tries to move past it. Yet, at the same time, it shows the siren call of the drugs and the feeling of inadequacy that haunts musicians who have convinced themselves they need the drugs to perform. While he most certainly still battles drug use in the \""modern\"" day, the musings and explanation as to why it is addictive (beyond it being just naturally addictive) to talented musicians elevates Born to Be Blue above classic musician biopics. It does not just show him using drugs, which would be deeply affecting on its own. Instead, it takes it a step further and shows him doing drugs, while explaining why he uses them, which practically rips your heart out."", """", ""In the lead role, Ethan Hawke is tremendous. I do not know if it was his real singing voice (I assume the trumpet was not him, maybe I am wrong), but he was terrific. Even if none of the music was him, his performance was still terrific. He really brings Baker to you and makes you feel empathy for him as you watch his downfall, rise, and self-medication. From his portrayal, Hawke makes the viewer root for Baker, even if you know he will trip and fall over-and-over again."", """", ""Visually, the film is very good. With lush blue hues touching many of the shots, Born to Be Blue imbues the film with the sadness and heartache felt by Baker. As he performs, the film is most prominently covered with blue, showcasing how something that should bring him so much instead brings so much agony given the self-doubt and addiction that haunts him as a result. The jazz music score itself even proves quite haunting at times with solemn notes accompanying many scenes."", """", ""As a whole, Born to Be Blue is a pretty good film with a killer lead performance from Ethan Hawke, as well as terrific use of color and a unique approach to a well-trodden tale of drug abuse by musicians."" ]";5

Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz are phenomenal in both emotionally intimate and distant roles (you have to see to understand), while the direction from Yorgos Lanthimos is assured and very good. Under the watch of a lesser talent, The Lobster would be a complete mess. Under Lanthimos, however, it is a fantastically enjoying film. From being a great look at romance in the modern era, being truly funny, and moving, The Lobster's only sin is the great amount of violence against animals. This is not really a cinematic critique, but I do not really appreciate that amount of violence against animals, particularly dogs. Call me a prude, but not my thing.

His second feature, and most notable until now, Blue Ruin was a tremendously brutal and suspenseful thriller. Green Room is pretty much the same deal, just shrouded in green and far more of a contained thriller than his previous effort. Starring Anton Yelchin, Imogen Potts, and Patrick Stewart, Green Room is a thriller about a punk band that witnesses a brutal murder while after performing for a group of neo-nazis. Now, they must escape while every neo-nazi in sight tries to keep them trapped."", ""In one of his final films released before his death (if not the final), Anton Yelchin is magnetic as Pat, the bassist of the band. As Amber, a girl who witnesses the murder, Imogen Potts is equally terrific. However, both pale in comparison to the performance of Patrick Stewart as Darcy, the leader of the neo-nazis. Ruthless, brutal, and quite sadistic, his Darcy is a fear-inducing character written with real menace by Saulnier. Stewart's performance is so captivating, he instills the viewer with fear even when he is off-screen."", ""In terms of his direction, Saulnier's Green Room is incredibly tight and focused. The film introduces very little in the way of subplots and even when it does, it reduces them to ash immediately. It is incredibly focused on the survival element at play here and every effort is poured into that area. In this area, Saulnier creates tension at every turn. Though the film is quite short, Saulnier is not afraid to take his time to create atmosphere and elicit tension through repeated sequences of uncertainty and attempted escapes. Unlike many thrillers/horror films, Green Room has no cheap thrills. Instead, they are well-earned."", ""Green Room is an incredibly violent picture with an unabashed love for boxcutters that has been unseen since 2014's Gone Girl. Ideally, Rosamund Pike and Imogen Potts are ushering in a new trend: blonde women with boxcutters. Just as in Blue Ruin, Saulnier is not afraid to get graphic, but he uses this violence well. It is not just violence for the sake of itself. Rather, it is violence that leaves the viewer in shock, regardless of whether it was expected or not."", ""However, one area in which the film can be improved is character development. Though incredibly tense, the film does very little to develop any of its characters, which kind of deprives the emotional impact of each individual's death to a degree. Plus, there are so many players in this film, it can be hard to keep track, especially when it comes to the neo-nazis. Additionally, though the film introduces neo-nazi characters, Saulnier never really uses it for any political symbolism. Sure, the punk band sings an anti-nazi song and makes a few comments about them, but it is hardly a major focus. While the film is an incredible thriller, it could have a more nuanced film with some kind of subtle statement about neo-nazis in modern day America, but that is just personal preference, I guess, so not really a criticism or a reason as to why this one is rated as it is."", ""As a whole, Green Room is a terrifically entertaining and intense thriller that is not shy about showing the audience casually brutal violence. Saulnier is one heck of a talent and his next work will be yet another must watch."" ]";5

It does not find its stride until the second half when it focuses on the serious effects of war on war reporters who are always risking their lives for the sake of a story. Here, the film is very dramatic and serious, yet works really well. I am not convinced it works too well with the first half of the film, but it really hits hard at times when you see the risks these people take for their craft. Tina Fey is very good here, as is Martin Freeman. The two of them have terrific chemistry and really draw you into the film. Additionally, the film is very much enjoyable. Even in the weaker first half, there are some very funny one-liners at times and then the serious take of the second half may be darker, but still has good takes on a middle aged woman trying to find herself in Kabul and in life. Plus, Fey is so charismatic, she remains endlessly watchable."", """", ""Unfortunately, the film does have many faults. It is not as funny as it should be and it tries to tackle too much in a limited time when it comes to the issues it raises. Additionally, it is pretty typical and hits all the notes of the middle aged person who is lost attempts to find themselves and meets weird people along the way narrative. That said, I did enjoy Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

Helen Mirren, Alan Rickman, Aaron Paul, and Barkhad Abdi, turn in very good performances here in this contemplative war thriller. Incredibly uncompromising, Eye in the Sky's dedication to showing you the unseen human element of warfare and the emotional turmoil it can cause is exemplary and commendable. Far too often, war films will avoid this exploration of human emotion and pain, instead focusing on action sequences. This is not the case at all with Eye in the Sky as it consistently considers the human aspect here and not just for the people behind the drones, but also the people on the ground who live near drone targets. In this way, Eye in the Sky has to be one of the better war films of recent memory. While not the best one of all-time, Eye in the Sky certainly ranks up there with the most emotionally damaging and haunting experiences I have had watching a war film. For this, Eye in the Sky truly is a winner. Incredibly dramatic, thrilling, and moving, it is a powerhouse of a film that feels like a punch to the gut."" ]";5

Though it is slow and deliberate, the film never drags and really always grips you as you watch it all unfold. The film is interesting in the sense that thought it focuses on Rampling's character, it really provides an astute look at how both men and women look at relationships, in particular at how they progress as the years go on. Wonderfully written and directed by Andrew Haigh, 45 Years is a phenomenal film that deservedly netted Rampling an Oscar nomination, but I do wish it had received more."" ]";5

With two terrific lead actors in Michael Shannon and Kevin Spacey, Elvis & Nixon is based on a single image of Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon in the White House. The rest rises out of an imagined reason for the meeting. In doing so, the film manages to delve into both Elvis and Nixon as people, serving as an interesting look at both of them, even if the story itself is not really true. However, what it lacks in truth, it makes up for with comedy. A smart and witty film, Elvis & Nixon is incredibly well-written as a comedy with lots of little references to real events and outright jokes. The end result of all of this is truly enjoyable hour and a half."", """", ""As Elvis, Michael Shannon is loud, boisterous, and magnanimous. However, he does not shy away from the internal struggles facing Elvis and the status of being a celebrity. Though far from unique in this, the film does a good job to evoke feelings of sympathy for \""The King\"". Remaining deified to this very day, he is rarely looked at as a person and the film does a good job to make us feel for him on a personal level. He is not just some kooky rock star who wants to be a federal agent, he is a real person and nobody ever gives him that time of day. Shannon's performance is truly magnetic and really carries the film on his shoulders."", """", ""As Nixon, Kevin Spacey is equally terrific. Though a lot of it is reminiscent of Frank Underwood in House of Cards, his Nixon feels quite accurate and stoic. Watching his transformation from when he is first told about Elvis wanting to meet him to when he actually meets him is quite comical. Yet, Spacey makes it feel authentic and really captures that \""not cool but want to be cool\"" essence that many people have, especially when in the presence of somebody cool. Spacey's turn here also provides many laughs, especially at the end when he is twirling the gun. There is a certain simplicity to the style of comedy in the film and Nixon captures most of the best lines in this one, with Spacey making the most of it with good delivery and timing."", """", ""However, in saying this, while the film is quite funny and a good look at both of its real life protagonists, Elvis & Nixon is an incredibly slight film. Coming in at just an hour and a half, Elvis & Nixon is largely just focused on this meeting and setting it up, while pretending to develop of a background relationship/issue for Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer), who is an associate and friend of Elvis. It can certainly drag as you just want them to get to the meeting. The romance background, which is barely looked at, is clearly there to just add some further dimension to the film, but even with that here, Elvis & Nixon rarely makes the case for being a feature-length film. While I did really enjoy my time with it, it probably would have been even better as a short film (40-50 minutes in length maybe), allowing it to be more focused on the photograph and meeting, rather than adding fluff to make it longer."", """", ""As a whole, Elvis & Nixon is a very funny film that may be a little too long for its story, but thanks to Shannon's Presley and Spacey's Nixon, the film is incredibly easy to watch."" ]";5

The acting across the board is very good, but the real star here are the technical elements. The special effects are terrific, especially in a scene where we see the boy with his eyes and the light coursing through his veins. The ending sequence also features terrific special effects and give the film a feeling along the lines of Spielberg's 70s and 80s science fiction classics due to the sense of wonder it inspires. The sense of mystery is highlighted by the film's synth-like score that really threatens to steal the show at times. Its low notes put you right on the edge and add this air of mystery that leaves you guessing until the very end. The lighting and cinematography are also top-notch, especially with the film largely taking place at night. It is always hard to shoot at night, but Midnight Special makes it look easy and, even better, the lighting lets you see everything, yet keep enough shrouded in darkness to make it both visually pleasing and mysterious. This film has a lot going on, is quite slow, and does not have a pay-off many will appreciate. However, I certainly did appreciate these elements. The slow pacing never arose as an issue because enough is going on to really keep you hooked and zoned in on what is going on in the film. Additionally, the ending is perfect simply because the proceeding 1 hour and 40 minutes were so mysterious. A mysterious ending is the only way to end this one as the characters never showed any level of understanding as to what was happening to the boy. Thus, it only makes sense that they remain in the dark along with us and get looked at as if they are crazy. Overall, Midnight Special is a special film that is wholly unique and highlights that Jeff Nichols is one of the best directors working today."" ]";5

As mentioned, Goodman is phenomenal with an intense and entirely gripping performance that plays very well into the air of mystery the film possesses. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is great here and John Gallagher Jr was also quite good. The film is a very compelling and thought-provoking one, lending itself greatly to further study as to character motivations and what all is really going on throughout the film. Some have criticized the ending, but I really am a fan. I thought it was a thrilling end to a thrilling film.

The heist sequences were great and the action was both thrilling and entertaining. I honestly do not understand the mixed response here, as though Triple 9 follows the genre expectations pretty closely, it never truly feels generic.

An absolutely hilarious homage and piece of social commentary (politics, Hollywood, human nature, etc.), Hail, Caesar is a really a movie about movies made for people who love movies and their history. Touching on all the key movements of the 1950s from the classic films to the politics therein, the film really skewers the time period and entertains along the way. Lavishly crafted with fantastic production and costume design, the film both looks and sounds the part. Channing Tatum honestly stole the show for me comedically, as all of his parts were hysterical. George Clooney, Josh Brolin, and Alden Ehrenhich, were the real stars here and knocked it out of the park. Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, and Frances McDormand, were also very good in smaller roles. Overall, Hail, Caesar is an absolute riot if you love film and film history. It appears many moviegoers thought it would be more of a serious kidnapping type movie, but if you know anything about the Coen Brothers, you know there is always more than meets the eye in their films and their classic kidnapping trademark.

For starters, Jennifer Lawrence and the entire cast is phenomenal. Many claim Lawrence did not deserve her Academy Award nomination, but my God did she ever. She was stupendous. Not my favorite performance of the year, but certainly up there. Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro were also quite good. Additionally, the pacing was fine, the film was always captivating, and the story had some very good comedic moments that had the whole theater in stitches. However, that is about where it ends. Yes, Lawrence's acting is good enough to outweigh everything else, namely the story. The story and the way it was written is deeply flawed. Based on a real woman, I have to assume the real story could not have been that bad that they had to Hollywoodize everything. Not only does Joy's story follow the traditional character arc and story structure a little too well, it just feels so fake. Even more, much of it designed to remind you of how strong a woman Joy is. I get that she is strong and independent, but I do not need a reminder every five seconds. I have no issue with strong women, but a film about one does not need to keep reminding you of such. Instead, it should demonstrate it. However, this is a sin the film commits quite often, as it often tells rather than shows, namely in the form of its narration. Entirely useless, the narration here is a major cop-out and is used solely to have forced exposition and connect scenes together. The script finds ways to get worse, however, as all of the characters are one-dimensional. Real humans do not act this way, let alone ones allegedly based on real ones. In particular, Joy's half-sister seemed to cruel and mean, yet there has to be more to her tale than the film let on. Ultimately, Joy is compelling, funny, and incredibly well-acted by Jennifer Lawrence, but its story handicaps it throughout."" ]";5

The film is a borderline haunting experience that thrives on subtlety, exemplified by Hoss' performance. The film has been described by others as being a bit of a noir film and this is most certainly true, but more than the mystery element here, for me is the drama. Phoenix is a film that rips your heart out as you watch this woman realize what has happened in the aftermath of her being sent to a concentration camp. Though Holocaust films are almost overdone at this point, Phoenix manages to breathe a breath of fresh air into this subset of films. Phoenix is deeply affecting and really rips your heart out repeatedly as you watch this woman grapple with the fact that her life is changed forever."" ]";5

A subtle romantic film, Carol's power is exquisitely defined in the expression on Therese Belivet's (Rooney Mara) face upon seeing Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) for the first time. The look of love at first sight, as if Carol were the answer to questions Therese had been subconsciously asking her whole life, the film's beauty and elegance is defined in that look. This film is the answer to the question: What is the most authentic romance film in years? Though I may not be gay or a woman, the romance here transcends any false boundary between humanity. In this, director Todd Haynes crafts a truly universal romance film that is for the entire world to behold in awe."", """", ""The same look on Therese's face is shared by Carol at the very end. As Therese walks slowly over to her and Haynes expertly uses slow motion to emphasize the moment, the look of subtle peace and joy highlights what this film does so well. It is not a teenage romance in any way. It is not excessive. It is not over-the-top. It is not cinematic love. Rather, it has a raw authenticity that is truly impossible to ignore. Instead, it consumes you and absorbs the viewer into this lush world that makes you experience the same love and pain as the characters."", """", ""This authenticity is translated into the screenplay, which is a thoroughly poetic and moving experience. The characters of Therese and Carol are so well defined, it is as if they are real human beings and this is merely their tale. The real emotions of love, pain, joy, and hurt, demonstrated by these women is impactful to the very core. However, its real success comes in the dialogue. Therese constantly shooting down Richard (Jake Lacy) and his offers to go away to Europe with him, while immediately accepting an offer to go away with Carol. The encounter between Carol and Harge (Kyle Chandler), in which Carol explains how having her daughter only for a short amount of time and being true to herself is better for her daughter than having her all the time and \""living against her own grain\"". Carol not only is a revelation for its power in terms of LGBT romance, but also in its communication of its character's feelings. Instead of explicitly telling you how they feel, it leaves it open for you to pick up on their intentions. Above all of other elements, this is what makes the film feel so authentic. They act and speak like real human beings who express their feelings, but not directly. These women leave bread crumbs for the viewer to figure out what really makes them tick. Not only does this indicate incredible trust given to the audience by Haynes, but it also highlights his trust in the writing and the actors to convey meaning."", """", ""Visually, the film is equally as stunning. Cinematographer Edward Lachman's camera is a magnet for beautiful shots. The heavy reliance upon reflections and mirrors is what truly caught my attention the most, especially when considering when they are utilized and the overall meaning of the film. Carol, above all, is a film about being true to one's self. Carol could have stayed with Harge and kept her daughter. Therese could have married Richard. Yet, neither felt truly satisfied in that life when without one another. Lachman captures this in his use of reflections. In one particular sequence, Therese goes with Carol to visit her home, with Richard bidding Therese goodbye before she leaves. As they drive, reflections abound. Symbolically, this most closely represents the double life being led by these women. A mirror merely reflects who you are, but is not you true self. It is other. This reflection is Therese's life with Richard. The camera then juxtaposes these shots with her in the car with Carol, highlighting how that is her true self. She is meant to be with Carol and it is her path to happiness."", """", ""Lachman and Haynes also use a notable color scheme for the entire film, with many shots being covered with an apparent green filter. These shots are accented by the heavy use of brown, red, and yellow. Interestingly, when Carol first visits with Therese, she is wearing red. However, after her daughter is taken from her and the two women see each other once more, it is Therese wearing red. As red often represents passion, one must assume that this is foreshadowing. Initially, Carol was the one pursuing this relationship. Therese knew she was infatuated with her, but was not confident enough to pursue her. Carol, meanwhile, had experience in the area and did pursue her. However, once her daughter leaves, she is more concerned with being reunited with her daughter, not being with Therese. The opposite is true for Therese, who has blossomed and is filled with passion and wonderous feelings for Carol."", """", ""Finally, the cherry on top of the film is score. Carter Burwell's score hits all the right notes and truly highlights the setting and feelings of the film. This is a very cozy and warm film. The colors certainly highlight this as well, as does the setting"" ]";5

Honestly, The Big Short may be the most entertaining and informative films I have watched in a film. Unique in its storytelling, entirely subversive, and odd/quirky, The Big Short is a great time and does a great job explaining its, at times, complex story. At no point do you feel lost or confused by its complex terminology, because it always bring it to the point where you can understand exactly what is happening. Even more, it is hysterically funny at times. Truly, it skewers its villains and twirls the knife with glee, though it does certainly leave its protagonists seeming more than a little morally and ethically ambiguous. Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell are absolutely phenomenal here. Christian Bale and Brad Pitt are also very, very good in their roles. Director Adam McKay manages to exceed all expectations with his directorial ability here and, honestly, I am not sure who else could have pulled it off with such a complex and unique way of telling this tale.

As it argues in favor of women's voting rights and equality as a whole, it is astounding to me that some of its major female characters were fictitious. Our protagonist is a fictitious character. Where there really no women worthy of having the film centered around them? I find that hard to believe. This, along with some other liberties taken, hold it back a bit to me. However, fortunately, there was more than enough to outweigh that. The direction from Sarah Gavron is great and the film is very well paced and never really drags, which is a major plus. In fact, for a historical drama, the film is truly thrilling at times. However, the main reason I truly enjoyed Suffragette is Carey Mulligan. She was phenomenal and a truly turned in one of the year's best performances. She was extraordinary and truly delivered a commanding and powerful performance as the fictional Maud Watts. The film also did a great job portraying everything these women gave up in their battle, namely their families. That is a level of sacrifice that has to be respected. Overall, Suffragette is an inspiring and powerful film that I wish was grounded with more historical facts and less interpretation and alteration, but was nonetheless a very good and very well made film."" ]";5
1033;chi-raq;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A great modern take on both the situation in Chicago and the ancient Greek play Lysistrata, Chi-raq is one of my favorite Spike Lee films. I say that as someone who does not really like Lee, so this one ranks as one of the few I do like. A provocative look at the situation in Chicago, the film makes you want to run out and change the world like portrayed in the film. The writing is phenomenal and incredibly creative and shows the great blending of the Greek comedy and the hip-hop influence to be found in the film. Nick Cannon, Teyonah Parris, Angela Bassett, and John Cusack, are all phenomenal here. Admittedly, the film can be a bit vulgar and far-fetched at times, but if you are willing to go where the film wants you to, it will be a very enjoyable experience. Though the plot itself can be messy, it is thematically tight and the pieces all work if you think about what they are symbolic of and are meant to represent, a lot of which ties to both the Greek-influence, as well as today's violence and sexuality. Chi-raq will not be for everyone, but was luckily for me."" ]";5

Featuring solid acting and a decent emotional story, the real success of Everest comes with the incredible visuals and special effects. Honestly, I felt cold felt watching these guys try to climb Mt. Everest successfully. As a story, it may feel generic and the guys who are portrayed here do deserve a better film about their true story and their life as guides on Everest. However, this one does do a decent job telling their story and certainly treats its real life people with tremendous respect and grace. Just because the story takes a backseat to the visuals does not mean it is ignored. An obvious front runner for numerous technical Academy Awards, Everest is a visual wonder that pulls all out of the stops visually and emotionally as you watch their harrowing climb and tragic demise."" ]";5

Patrick Wilson, Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins, and Matthew Fox, are all great in this one and really have chemistry as a group. The mysterious savages who are causing havoc on their town and on the frontier as a whole are a truly terrifying group and really have no problems making you entirely terrified of them. The film is also really well shot and has a good score that fits both the western and horror genres. My main problem here is the graphic and, really, unnecessary violence. The film is very good, but gets hampered by its apparent willingness to make its audience violently ill. There is truly no call for that and I should not have to see what this film put me through. As an overall picture, however, Bone Tomahawk is a very well executed film that really blends horrors and westerns quite well, while also managing to be endlessly captivating."" ]";5

Incredibly masturbatory at times, The Hateful Eight is still a very good film that is beautifully shot, features a great score Ennio Morricone, and great performances from Walton Goggins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir, and Tim Roth. As a whole, the entire cast is great, but those were just the performances that stuck out to me. The film is just as violent as one would expect from a Tarantino film, but as always, it is incredibly stylish and so over the top, it does not feel as bloody as it is, though this film will definitely leave you sitting in awe a few times from the suddenness of the violence.

Instead, we got to focus in on a fascinating story that features a fantastic performance from Tom Hanks at the very center of it. A captivating story from the Cold War, Hanks plays a man who is keenly aware of the situation around him, but does not let it cloud his humanitarian beliefs, which is truly noble. He knocks this role out of the park and his talent is only matched by a terrific performance from Mark Rylance. The direction from Steven Spielberg is also very good and he reminds us of just how talented he truly is. The Coen brothers script is also very good as expected and really shows how good of a writing team they are, though I obviously love when they're in the director's chair too. However, what holds Bridge of Spies back is that though I find it truly captivating, it is a true story. As such, no matter how captivating, it is held back a bit by the constraints of that and its dedication to accuracy. As such, it winds up not being quite as good of a film as it tries to cover so much pertinent information and, as such, winds up being a little longer than needed. That being said, Bridge of Spies is still a good film that is a great combo of great acting from Hanks and direction from Spielberg."" ]";5

It can be quite funny and quite scary at times, but you are never really sure where the comedy ends and the horror begins, which is problematic. However, the film manages to throw yet another genre in the mix, as it is a pretty entertaining and well crafted thriller as well. Therefore, I have no idea what this film really is, other than an at times awkward mishmash of genres. That being said, nobody does creepy like M. Night Shyamalan. The film is truly creepy and unsettling at times, which helps it out. Plus, I really liked the twists and turns the film took, as well as the found footage element. The acting is pretty good, but I really wish the film felt less disjointed because of its genre. Regardless, I will take this one as a sign that Shyamalan is getting closer to returning to form because this one is not just enjoyable, but pretty well made, creative, and creepy."" ]";5

These stories intertwine and take place in the fictional town of Bailey Downs. Sitting high above the town is DJ Dangerous Dan (William Shatner), who is hysterical in the role. Though a mixed bag and the stories jumping between one another does hurt momentum a good bit, A Christmas Horror Story is a generally fun and entertaining horror ride that may not be the best thing I have ever watched, but it is certainly scary and more than worth your time."", ""The first story concerns three teenagers, Dylan, Ben, and Molly. The local school had a murder the year before in the basement, which was once an old convent. The three go to investigate for what is presumably a news report for a broadcast journalism course. The murders had a particularly religious bend to them with a Biblical quote from the Book of Isaiah proclaiming the birth of Christ written in blood on the wall. A guy and girl were found murdered, with the guy being crucified on the wall. As the night progresses, the three get locked in this section of the school and begin seeing things, namely a girl who had been in the convent, claimed to be a virgin yet pregnant, and died while trying to abort her baby. It turns out in this section that this demon girl wanted somebody to carry her baby for her, no matter the price. Given the quote on the wall, the time of year, the abortion, the persistence, and the bloody eyed Mary statue, I interpreted this baby to be the Antichrist. Given the presence of Krampus, the anti-Santa Claus, in the film, this is hardly far fetched and makes this section of the film make a whole of sense. As it stands, I did enjoy this section actually. Though pretty typical, it was one of my favorites and I was itching to get back to it whenever it cut away."", ""The second story concerns Police Officer Scott, his wife Kim, and their son Will. A cop at the scene of the crime last year, Scott is still incredibly shaken by what he saw. While on a trip to cut a Christmas tree from the woods, Will is possessed or something by a changeling. Chaos ensues and this section was not that interesting, honestly. At least with the first part, there was a great mystery as to what was happening. Here, it was pretty obvious Will was possessed and that everything was not as it seemed. It just depended on how long it took for Scott and Kim to realize their son was not with them. Overall, it is passable, but simply took too long and was largely quite dull."", ""The third story comes back to the people in the first story again with one of their friends, Caprice, stuck going on a family trip with her dysfunctional family. A run in with Krampus makes all of their problems come to the surface and also teaches the fundamental lesson of Christmas: Santa may not be real, but the spirit of Christmas is real and is within us all. Similarly, the spirit of Krampus can enter you and cause serious harm. Though not an absolutely stellar section, it does have some touching family moments, as well as moments of sheer terror."", ""Finally, the last one is set in the North Pole, but actually relates to DJ Dangerous Dan. With the elves turning into zombies, Santa must kill them all before they kill him. The same even goes for Martha Claus (\""SAVE....MARTHA!\"" - Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman, Batman v. Superman). Orchestrated by his archrival Krampus, the ending of this section is a bummer, even if it does make sense. During the parts with DJ Dangerous Dan, it is revealed that there is a hostage situation at the mall. As it turns out, it is just Norman - the meteorologist for Dan's show - thinking that he is Santa with the zombie elves. Thus, this whole section occurs in Norman's head and is really just a dream. Though it has great production design and is a very cool concept, the ending is a let down. That said, it does gel well with the other sections and the ideas about the Christmas/Krampus spirit. However, even with the bad ending, this section is still far and away the most raucous fun presented by this film with good zombie design and then the promised battle between Santa and Krampus."", ""Overall, A Christmas Horror Story is a fun and diverting film that, while flawed, has some very scary parts and is a largely entertaining film about the Christmas spirit and the birth of Christ."" ]";5

Mamie Gummer is also great as her daughter and Rick Springfield does quite well as Ricki's bandmate and boyfriend. The film is quite well written by Diablo Cody and well directed by Jonathan Demme, though neither are fantastic, but get the job done here. The film is also quite funny and touching throughout, seamlessly transitioning between serious and comedic scenes with nary a hitch.

With very good comedic writing, Ghostbusters is funny from beginning to end and truly never lets up. Heck, I was laughing even during the credits and the post credits scene. The film is funny, through and through. The girls have great chemistry with one another and Kate McKinnon particularly is fantastic. Leslie Jones is no slouch, however, and is fantastic. I had low expectations for her since she is hit-and-miss for me, but she was phenomenally funny. All four have great timing, though they all kind of get overshadowed by Chris Hemsworth. His turn as the dumb bimbo of an assistant is terrific. Every word he says is hysterical and never failed to make me laugh. I was rolling in my chair with how funny some of it was. This film is a true joy to experience and is thoroughly funny. On top of this, the special effects were great. The ghost design was scary and light, while also looking quite cool. The gags with ghosts were also solid and very funny (especially during the final battle sequence). Additionally, I saw it in 3D and the 3D was fantastic. I rarely love 3D and think it makes a difference, but it absolutely was the case here. The 3D was great and, on one occasion, made me jump so bad. In short, I loved this. It was a great experience and it is sad that people were predetermined to hate it because it \""is ruining their childhood\"" or is \""anti-man, Paul Feig hates men and I hate feminism ahhh\"". Idiots. There are legitimate problems with the film, but few negative reviews actually rely on these and instead rely on perceived insults to men, none of which is the case. The villain is poorly done and the plot is certainly not fantastic, but neither really matter to me, because it is a comedy. It is supposed to be fun and boy oh boy is it ever fun.

However, as a look at gambling and addiction, Mississippi Grind has a major problem; how did this duo fund everything? It is largely left a mystery until it is convenient for it not to be.

After Prisoners and Enemy, for him to manage top both of them so resoundingly with Sicario is impeccable. A brilliantly directed, intense, and edge of your seat film, Sicario is a phenomenal movie. Sicario manages to cover the drug war and cartels as violently and as bleak as it should without being too violent or too bleak. Though, it still paints an incredibly grim picture of the situation and nobody winds up looking good in this situation. I should also mention that Roger Deakins is the best living cinematographer. His work on this film is magnificent. One of the best shots films I have honestly ever seen, this one follows up one beautifully shot scene with another beautifully shot scene and uses every technique in the book to the very peak of its potential. Emily Blunt is phenomenal here, but is actually outdone by Benicio del Toro. I love Del Toro's work, but this has to be his very best. He is out of this world in this role and hits a complete home run. Sicario is a fantastic film and one of the year's strongest works, but what do you expect when Villenueve, Deakins, Blunt, and Del Toro, work together?"" ]";5
1044;american-ultra;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The cinematic version of a laggy internet connection, American Ultra is filmed through a cloud of smoke and that is all too appropriate for this stoner action comedy. Similar to Pineapple Express, the film derives its comedy from placing slow (both in speech and brains) stoners in improbable situations with guns. In fairness, this is a terrific formula for an action comedy. Starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, American Ultra is the definition of easy watching. It is solidly funny, solidly action-packed, and great for watching on demand. If you pay to watch this film, the joke is really on you."", ""Comedy-wise, American Ultra largely relies upon the hilarious nature of its premise, as well as its protagonists. Thanks to the good acting from Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, this largely works out quite well as the deliver the lines with the right speed and level of curiosity to really drive home the subtly comedy. In many ways, the film mirrors the experience of being around a friend while they are stoned. Initially, it may be thoroughly hysterical. After a while, it does grow grating. Fortunately, American Ultra recognizes this and is mercifully only 90 minutes, which largely prevents it from overstaying its welcome. That said, it does not provoke that many laughs. For a film about a stoner sleeper agent, the film really is quite reserved and does not go for the gold too often. Instead, it is fine with producing decent chuckles along the way, instead of fully committing to the sheer lunacy of its premise."", ""Where the comedy slacks, the chemistry between Eisenberg and Stewart really shines. First demonstrated in Adventureland, this odd couple duo really work well with one another. American Ultra is no exception as the film is quickly able to develop their romance and relationship with incredible believability. While everything else in the film is ludicrous and over-the-top, the film really manages to craft a solid romance along the way in which their devotion to one another becomes incredibly evident."", ""In terms of its action, American Ultra certainly delivers the good. With stylish action akin to a Tarantino flick, but with the sped up action moments that, for whatever reason, reminded me of Zombieland due to its casual, yet stylish nature, the film is entertaining. Heavy on blood effects and inventive kills (a man is killed by a spoon...), American Ultra has a ton of fun with its characters and situation. The end result is a largely infectious feeling, instilled by these action sequences. Even better, it never takes itself too seriously and solely seeks to entertain. While the world is crumbling around them, Eisenberg's Mike Howell and Stewart's Phoebe Larson freak out alongside it, but match it with killer instincts when it comes time to fight for their lives. Thus, while quite bloody, the action scenes are intense and worthwhile."", ""All of this said, American Ultra is never a good film. It is the very definition of a Redbox rental. It is a film you grab because you are too lazy to really try and find something else to watch. However, it is also not a bad film. With solid comedy and good action sequences, as well as typically good performances, there is more going on in American Ultra than meets the eye. Plus, who does not appreciate John Leguizamo hamming it up as a West Virginia gangster? While not the most challenging film ever made, this one is a solidly put together action comedy that under-utilizes its talented cast, but is fun while it lasts."" ]";5

I should also mention that the costume design matches this style brilliantly with some seriously great suits and dresses. Not a fashion connoisseur by any means, but man did both the guys and women in this film look sharp. As a whole, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. never takes itself too seriously and is very funny, while also having very thrilling action sequences throughout that are incredibly well shot and well directed. For me, I preferred this to the other recent spy film, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, though both are very different as that one aims to be serious, while this film takes a far more comedic approach.

An honest look at both high school, friendships, and death, Me & Earl & the Dying Girl is funny from beginning to end and guaranteed to make you fight back tears (a fight you will more than likely lose). The film is also a film nerds wet dream with so many references and mentions of classic films that the film itself is as much as an homage to classic films as the amateur films made by the characters. Though there are better coming of age dramedies out there, Me & Earl & the Dying Girl is certainly one of the better ones I have seen thanks to great acting, directing, writing, and a heartfelt story that feels so relatable it almost hurts.

Each line of dialogue is crucially important and revealing about the character who says it, but it is left to you to decipher what it could possibly mean. The film is also really well shot and much of the tension comes from the framing of these shots and the mystery surrounding the proceedings. Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton are phenomenal in this one and Rebecca Hall also turns in a very strong performance.

After the death of her husband, she is driving to meet her parents who have her daughter Fleming with them to spend the weekend. However, after a rare California snow dusting, the slick roads lead to her getting into a car accident. Nearing death, she is shocked back to life by a lightning bolt that hits the water she is submerged in and, unbeknownst to her, it changes her life forever. From that day on, she stops aging. What unfolds is a film that may not be revolutionary, but is nonetheless an interesting concept realized in a minor chick flick fashion that manages to still be interesting, but too focused on being cute to really delve too deep into its questions."", ""Ignoring the fact that poor Adaline is an awful driver and that defibrilators/lighting do not have that kind of impact on a person, The Age of Adaline is nonetheless a compelling film. Introducing the fact that she is now set to live forever, the film smartly shows the good with the bad. Given all the time in the world, she can slowly grow her investment portfolio, accumulate knowledge about various world events, and learn many different languages. Constantly moving and getting new identities to hide from those who would want to study her, Adaline also gets the rare chance to live many different lives and to see a variety of places throughout the world, though her heart is always in San Francisco. Being able to live forever, if one is willing to accept the bad, can be an enlightening experience that has allowed Adaline to have a ringside seat to history for the entirety of her life."", ""However, the bad is very bad. Having to disconnect from emotion in its entirety, Adaline only allows herself two things: her daughter Fleming (Ellen Burstyn) and her dog. Unfortunately, when that dog dies, she is forced to once again confront the fact that everybody else is mortal and she is cursed with immortality. Pushing away men who would fill the void in her life quite gladly, Adaline's existence may be one that is knowledge-filled, but it is empty. She has been forced to box her emotions away in order to avoid feeling hurt over-and-over again whenever somebody she loved passed away. At a certain point, watching the men and animals you love constantly die becomes depressing and opening your heart to another love becomes something to actively avoid out of fear of letting your heart get broken yet again. While the film never really goes beyond the horror of living forever being found in constantly losing those that you love (plus the inevitability of Fleming's death), it remains a compelling issue that the film smartly focuses upon. In introducing one of her old love interests, William (Harrison Ford), the added wrinkle of telling William that Adaline is dead (she was going under the alias of Jenny, claiming that Adaline was her mother) is an interesting one. With Ford turning in a very good performance, he allows us to see the pain on his face when he learns that Adaline died, both the solemn realization that he is getting old and the knowledge that what he had with her is gone forever without any hope. In a way, this is the film's method of telling the audience that avoiding heartbreak is impossible. Instead, it is a part of life whether you age or not. However, at the very least, William's aging has allowed him to find a woman he loves in place of Adaline and not be forced to watch her, or anyone else's, life from the outside looking in to avoid being hurt. It has allowed him to live, have regrets, look to the past fondly, and look to the future with equal fondness. For Adaline, however, she has regrets, but has no life out of fear of the future and out of pain dominating the past."", ""However, through its constantly obtrusive narrator that just spits out exposition at an unrelenting pace, The Age of Adaline feels afraid to really explore its possibly complex and moving themes. Instead, it opts to sanitize it and bring it down to wide-ranging accessibility. In the process, it opts to go for quick grabs at pathos - dead dog - and not developing its supporting characters beyond the very bare minimum. As a result, the film winds up feeling rather sterilized. While director Lee Toland Krieger may have wanted to explore deeper ideas, this is not the script or the film where that as possible with the narration and general \""playing-it-safe\"" nature of the film really undermining its heady themes."" ]";5

In essence: I did everything I was told to do and I did it well, so why is there not \""more\""? Unfortunately, life is a moving target. There is no set date or event that will define your life as being successful. Instead, it is the sum of all actions you took in your life that define you in the end and in the now with each moment adding up to the end product. Expecting your life to be final and totaled up in any moment prior to your death is a phenomenon experienced by many, but unfortunately not realistic."", ""It is for this thematic rumination that The Big Chill really becomes a timeless work from director Lawrence Kasdan. Quietly considering the idea that one's life is never really complete and that the feeling that something is missing is a natural one, The Big Chill is a film that benefits from never showing Alex. Originally casting Kevin Costner, but cutting out all of his scenes, the film's themes and ideas would feel cheapened by including Alex and his suicide. Plus, it would leave nothing to chance. Perhaps Alex was depressed, yes. Perhaps it was because he slipped away from the group. However, it is also just as likely that Alex was suffering from the feeling that something was missing, with his various career paths representing his attempts to fill that empty part of himself. With everybody coming together to mourn Alex, it is a nice touch to leave Alex out of the film and let the living try and figure out how they can avoid becoming Alex, as all of them demonstrate the same level of dissatisfaction and emptiness that Alex felt in his post-graduate life."", ""However, the film is held back by some odd plot elements. Desperate for a child, Meg laments how Harold is married only for Sarah to loan out her husband to Meg for the night to make a baby. Huh? There just has to be a better way to approach this issue for Meg that does not demand having your husband impregnate her."" ]";5

Jack O'Connell is marvelous in this heart pounding tale of a British soldier caught behind enemy lines and the efforts of many to get their hands on him. Brilliantly directed by Yann Demange, the tension is palpable throughout and the suspense is fantastic. Though taking place outside, the film is almost claustrophobic in a way, given the way O'Connell's character feels trapped on all sides and does not know where to turn. The Troubles have always been able to be turned into great films and '71 is no exception, as this one is not so much a war film as it is a thriller and a darn good thriller it is."" ]";5

Largely derivative of many past westerns, Slow West does enough to separate itself from better westerns by taking some twists and turns along the way that really do surprise you. Even more, the great acting really makes this one stand out from the pack and, even if its story is familiar, makes it worth watching. The cinematography, production design, costume design, and music, are also all fantastic and really do a great job capturing the beauty of the setting and setting the tone for the film. On the whole, Slow West is a fantastic put together little film that will entertain if you enjoy slow-building westerns."" ]";5

Director David Robert Mitchell knows how to truly scare you and he does it with pure glee and abandon by keeping you on edge from the get go. The acting from Maika Monroe is great. The cinematography is also fantastic. However, none of this would be enough to make it as good as I believe it to be. Rather, the sound is what sets it above all other horror films that do everything else I mentioned very well.

Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, and Chloe Grace Moretz, are all phenomenal here and turn in great performances. Stewart was my personal favorite, though the against type performance from Moretz was really interesting and well done. The story is very dense, but can be boiled down to being about an aging woman having a relationship with a younger woman, after having the shoe be on the other foot when she was younger. Now that she is older, she struggles to grapple with this age and the shoe being on the other foot, due to her own approach to the relationship when she was younger. In this way, the film is a compelling look at aging, both on stage and in life, and at relationships of all kinds. Finally, the cinematography is fantastic. The film has repeated gratuitous shots of landscapes in the Swiss alps and thank God for that because is pure eye candy. The cinematography in non-landscape scenes is also great though and that point cannot be understated. Clouds of Sils Maria is a great little film that really deserves more attention from film lovers due its well-written and well-directed approach to its subjects."" ]";5

Though  I have not seen the first three, I opted to see this one due to the great word of mouth and ultimately, I was incredibly satisfied. With an absolutely riveting world created that seems vast and unique in nature, Fury Road feels just like an epic action film should. Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult, are all fantastic, especially Hoult who really steals the show at times. The makeup is great and completely convincing. However, the real star here for me was the beautiful cinematography (which is gorgeous btw) and phenomenal special effects, which were the definition of perfection. The car chases featured both very well, which is why those scenes were undoubtedly my favorite and probably some of the most exhilarating and well plotted car chases I have seen in a film. Truly a great action film, if I was an action junkie, this would be a 10/10, but I am not.

Truly, this one is incredibly sleek and sexy as a thriller, but also manages to have enough humor and quality one-liners to make it passable as a comedy. When watching Focus, however, it is hard to take your eyes off of Margot Robbie, who really knocks this role out of the park, as does Will Smith. Without their coolness and charisma in the lead roles, Focus would be a far lesser film and they really exude the right type of personality to convince you of damn near anything, as conmen should. Overall, Focus is not a great film, but is quite well made and is just stylish enough to overcome its many shortcomings."" ]";5

They are good to very good, but I am not in love with him as a director. However, I do like all of his films. Why? As exemplified in Blackhat, they are visually stunning. This film looks like a Michael Mann directed film with some killer cinematography, great lighting, and Mann's typical visual style. A timely an exciting, even if far-fetched, plot surrounds the stunning visuals and it most certainly entertains and thrills along the way. People tend to really not like this film (as evidenced by a 34% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes and 24% from the audience), but I really enjoyed Blackhat. If you love Mann's visual style, as exemplified mainly in films such as Collateral and Miami Vice, then Blackhat is the film for you."" ]";5

Slow, dreadfully dull, and as precise as surgery, Mr. Turner is a film that is marvelously directed, acted, and shot, but sitting in the DMV has proved to be more engaging. This film's cinematography is other worldly and cinematographer Dick Pope has provided some of the best shots of the decade with his work here. Unfortunately, the film is skin deep. It is like a hot girl that thinks she is smart, but is actually really dumb and lacks personality. I rarely call a film pretentious, but I feel as though Mr. Turner fits the bill. Hollow and packed to the brim with self-importance, the appeal of Mr. Turner is wholly lost on me. It gets as high a rating as it does from me for a few reasons: the aforementioned cinematography (particularly the slow pans from characters to shots of scenery are brilliant), the costume design, and the production design. All of these leave the film being a visual masterpiece of the highest order. Yet, the story elements and character elements are all beyond lackluster and lacking any sort of depth. The writing here is quite poor and the film is overlong. It would have been well served to actually develop its characters and cut some of the runtime.

The acting is very good as well, but the real star here is the camera. With the film being light on plot, the camera work steals the show and really pulls out all of the possible beauty in the film. In addition, the atmosphere cultivated by Aminpour and the composer is great as it really keeps you on edge, though I certainly wish there was more a pay-off when it comes to vampires and the sucking of blood. Nowhere near as scary or horrorish as it should have been, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night falls short of being great for that reason and unlike other films that fall short here (Let the Right One In, another vampire flick, for example) it does not offer enough to overcome that. Regardless, it is a very good work that deserves praise."" ]";5

Hell, there may not even be a case. But, what is certain is that he has no idea what is going on and neither does the audience. Impossible to follow and impossible to wrap your head around, Inherent Vice is a film that gives you a bunch of different puzzle pieces from different puzzles and tells you to put them together. Yet, in spite of that, I loved it. Our confusion mirrors that of Doc and really makes the film and enjoyable watch. It also does not hurt that it has a stellar cast on top of Joaquin Phoenix, including Benecio del Toro, Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, Katherine Waterston, Joanna Newsom, Michael K. Williams, and Martin Short. No one other than Phoenix has that much screen time, but what they are given, they knock out of the park. The direction and writing from Paul Thomas Anderson are stellar as always. The film also does a great job capturing the drug-induced era it is set in and is a beautiful snapshot of the less than nice areas of Los Angeles in the 1970's. If you are comfortable not knowing what the hell is going on, but are willing to still sit there and try to piece together this possibly unsolvable \""case\"", Inherent Vice is the film for you. Though it may not make much sense, Inherent Vice is just a really enjoyable and really, really well made film that even if the \""plot\"" does not do it for you, there should be enough here for you to appreciate."" ]";5

I had high expectations for her performance and she certainly lived up to them. She was awesome. The soundtrack here, highlighted by the Lana Del Rey track, is also great. The song \""Big Eyes\"" was used perfectly in the film and truly communicated the feelings Margaret Keane was feeling at the moment. On top of that, the script and plot were awesome, plus they were told very well through Tim Burton's direction. I do not love Burton, but he was great here in telling the story. On that note, the plot was very interesting. Very interesting story and enjoyable to watch unfold. Art is not something that really interests me, but when put on screen in this fashion, it was riveting. I also loved the cinematography. I do not know if I was seeing things, but there seemed to be some effect put on Adams' eyes reminiscent of the eyes in her paintings, which I thought was really cool."", """", ""On the negative, some plot elements felt...extra. Namely Krysten Ritter's entire character (her acting was also sub-par). I typically love Christoph Waltz and Jason Schwartzman, but neither were amazing here. They were solid and, in particular Waltz, had moments of sheer brilliance, but felt comically over the top at times, which really messed with the tone of the film. Finally, the film has a really contained feel to it. Biographical films can feel this way sometimes and this one certainly does. It felt very small and as if it was just trying to hit certain marks, which is something I never really enjoy."", """", ""As a whole, Big Eyes is a good, enjoyable film with a fantastic performance from Amy Adams and good direction from Tim Burton that both combine to make this one well worth your time."" ]";5

However, beyond them, the film remains brilliant. A compelling look at artificial intelligence, of the possible pitfalls, and the ethical questions surrounding them (are they real? how far is too far?), Ex Machina delivers some heady thoughts and manages to thoroughly entertain beyond that as well. The acting is great, yes, but the direction and writing from Alex Garland are also great and he really brings this one home. The design of the artificial intelligence is brilliant, as well. More technically, this one's pacing is perfect and it is just as long as it needs to be and the score is brilliant. The score sets the scene perfectly every time and is used to perfection. Overall, Ex Machina is one of the year's best films and establishes Garland as a force to be watched in the director's chair as well."" ]";5

That is what makes this film so special, as it breaks down those walls and allows everyone from every different clique to really see the others as they truly are: people just like them. However, what I really liked about the film is one of the discussions they have at the end, where they discuss how their friendships will be once detention ends. This discussion really rings true as I think everybody knows that these kids will never see one another afterwards and, if they do, they may ignore them or mock them after seeing them because of high school social pressures. While this one is a very accurate representation of high school and all of its oddities, it is also very funny. At many times, I found myself laughing quite hard at something somebody said or did.

With a stunning lead performance from David Oyelowo coupled by a tremendous and large supporting cast, Selma manages to capture the importance of every moment depicted, largely due to director Ava DuVernay's passion for the subject. Her passion bleeds through the screen as you can see the love and respect which she has for those depicted. This passion is contagious as the film truly puts you in the shoes of Dr. King and his fight across the nation, particularly in Selma. Smartly focusing on one event in Dr. King's career and the Civil Rights Movement as a whole, Selma is able to properly broach the topic and give it the weight it deserves, rather than skimming through it as part of a larger biopic. Plus, it allows the supporting cast tor really shine, namely Stephan James and Rep. John Lewis. He is terrific in the role and knocks it out of the park. The film is magnificently written with each word dripping with weight and power. The cinematography is inspired, perfectly capturing the towering presence of Dr. King brought on by the power of his words. Selma is a film that never stops and never stutters. Rather, it is a film that will stick with you for a long time as you revel in the magnitude of its strength."" ]";5

Fast paced and funny throughout, Rock takes various approaches in this day in the life look at falling comedy superstar Andre Allen who has struggled with alcoholism in the past, as well as various other personal struggles. The film is casually honest, which is an approach I very much like. You see Rock's character do various things that show how hard it to be famous, yet the film never makes too big of a deal about it. In this way, for a comedy, the film really does not hold your hand and does not dumb itself down for its audience. Instead, the film wants rigorous honesty from its characters and is not afraid to show it to you, if you are willing to go along with them. A funny, honest, and at times moving film, Top Five is smart, subtle, and believable comedy."" ]";5

Heck, even the characters are very well done and have nice little arcs to them. That said, the acting is spotty, the film is decidedly dull, and I typically avoid chalking up sexism as a con unless blatant, but the fact the film pretends to be feminist is what makes me do this. Ultimately, the film could use better pacing, but as it stands this one largely satisfied me.

This one has some killer direction, acting, sound effects, cinematography, and writing. The director, Jennifer Kent, did a fantastic job setting the mood of this one and knocked it out of the ballpark direction wise. For the aforementioned sound effects, they are truly what cause the scares. Much like in Alfred Hitchcock's classic film Psycho, the sound elicits a major reaction out of the viewer and really sets the tone for the scenes in which that sound is used. Brilliant. Honestly, this one of the most well-executed uses of metaphor of symbolism I have seen in a while, The Babadook is a brilliant film wrongly placed in the \""horror\"" genre. Truly terrifying, The Babadook is more than just a horror film. It is a meditation on life and dealing with loss. It also made me screech like a high school girl being asked to prom by her crush in the way it used that symbolism and hit a home run with it (ahhhh flower symbolism ahhhh). While some scenes are classic horror in the way they elicit a response, the true terror is to be found underneath the skin and the way in which it hits home and brings a feeling to true terrifying life. Ultimately, I recognize this type of film is not for everyone, but The Babadook is a film that let's everyone know how grief feels and brings that feeling to life because ultimately, \""If it's a word or it's a look, you can't get rid of The Babadook\"".

After loving Bennett Miller's first two features, Capote and Moneyball, I had high hopes that with such interesting subject matter and a great cast, this one would be a home run. It, sadly, was not. However, it is still far from a bad film and instead above average. It is well-written and features some stellar acting from Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo, and Channing Tatum. The mise en scene is also quite strong and the makeup is stellar. Carell's complete transformation into John Du Pont being the stand out when it comes to the makeup. Incredible work. The costume design is also quite good. However, this one is decidedly not a great film despite these positives because it is far too slow and really plodded along for much of the film. If it had half of the intensity featured in the trailer and was a touch shorter, it would have been a far better film, but as it stood, despite the creepy and odd atmosphere present in every scene, most scenes lacked the intensity needed. There is considerable tension found in most scenes, but they don't have much of an impact. Overall, Foxcatcher could have been far better, but as it stands, is a solid film that continues to show Bennett Miller as a great director who knows his way around biographical dramas."" ]";5

Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook are magnetizing in this odd science fiction/fantasy film that is a time travel movie, but uses it in incredibly unique fashions that constantly leave you guessing. While the final reveal is obvious to anyone putting the pieces together, it only clarifies within the last half hour so it is not like the entire film is predictable. That said, the entire film is a bit of a trip and likely contradicts itself (as most time travel movies do), but is a truly enthralling flick that wraps you up in its world and does not let go until the very end.

1074;before-i-go-to-sleep;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Upon its release, Rowan Joffe's Before I Go to Sleep often received comparisons to Memento as that film was also a thriller that focused on an amnesiac trying to remember how he wound up the way he is and figure out who he can trust. However, I not like Memento, so I went into Before I Go to Sleep without comparing it to a film that I enjoy. As a result, I did quite like Before I Go to Sleep. It is undeniably cliched and introduces memories or random actions by Christine Lucas (Nicole Kidman) out of plot convenience that entirely contradict the fact that she cannot remember. The film also nosedives into melodrama at the very end with a tearjerking final sequence that may make you cry, but feels manipulative. That said, the film is just so tense. It is mysterious, thrilling, and laced with suspense as we live alongside Christine as she tries to figure out who attacked her and deals with emotions evoked by memories, all while trying to figure out who to trust."", ""Following a brutal attack, Christine Lucas remembers nothing. She believes she is in her 20s and wakes up everyday being informed about who she is, where she is, and what she does by her husband Ben (Colin Firth). After Ben leaves for work, Dr. Nasch (Mark Strong) calls her and reminds her to check for a camera in her wardrobe closet where she records a visual diary daily. He then proceeds to meet her during the day behind Ben's back, who does not want her to remember for fear of her getting upset. The film's tensions continue to rise as we are given cause to not trust both Ben and Dr. Nasch at various points before we come back and believe them again, only to then proceed to continue questioning if they are what they say they are. This is the source of Before I Go to Sleep's greatest amount of tension as this mystery and suspense that unfolds rivals something akin to a Hitchcock film with how it keeps you in the dark. With Christine's illness, we constantly must try and add two-and-two together with the limited details that she can add throughout the day. What compounds the mystery is the fact that both Firth and Strong are British and as Hollywood has taught me, never trust a Brit because they are all shifty. Yet, the film forces us to pick who to trust and it makes it all the more compelling as common sense says neither are wholly trustworthy."", ""Plot-wise, as mentioned, the film is pretty run-of-the-mill. This may be writer-director Rowan Joffe's fault as the film entirely relies upon the disease of its protagonist and then willingly breaks the rules it sets when convenient, particularly with regard to the reveal of who her attacker was. After initially stating that going to the site of the attack does not work, the film then goes and has the site of the attack bring back memories of it for Christine. That said, when the film threatens to just boil down into a pretty typical who can you trust thriller, it throws in a compelling twist that really breathes life into the film seamlessly. This final twist is really what saves Before I Go to Sleep from being a pretty tame thriller, as well as excellent lead performances from Nicole Kidman, Colin Firth, and Mark Strong. Each actor turns in a shifty performance that really makes you begin to wonder their true intentions, only to then turn around and seem entirely trustworthy. Yet, we know somebody cannot be trusted. Is it Christine? Is her broken mind playing tricks on her even now? Is it Ben? Is he really just protecting her or is he hiding more? Is it Dr. Nasch? Is he really a doctor? Why does he now want Ben to find out about the treatment? For all of its cliches and narrative shortcomings, Before I Go to Sleep winds up still being a truly entertaining film that shows that a fun, twisty, and slick thriller that has echoes of Hitchcock (who would have directed the hell out of this) can still turn into a pretty good piece of cinema. While not exactly an artistic accomplishment and one that could have used a more capable of director, this one entertains and constantly keeps you an edge with a chilling premise, excellent acting, and eerie score."" ]";5

Some have cited the influence of The Twilight Zone and from what I have heard about that show, it probably makes sense. However, in terms of film, Coherence largely stands alone. Showing the events of a dinner party during the passing of a comet, Coherence is a film that really messes with your mind from beginning to end and forces you to keep up with it. Fortunately, Byrkit avoids any unnecessary exposition, which really helps to add to the atmosphere. This confused and lost party and their fear is matched by the audience as we try to piece things along with them. Byrkit could have lost their confusion if he kept stopping to explain everything. Instead, he pushes the pedal to the metal and plunges forward."", """", ""Featuring a largely unknown cast, Coherence is not necessarily a film about its characters. That said, the acting across the board is solid. Plus, the writing of the characters is solid. Nothing extraordinary, nor are they incredibly deep, but their pasts and their stories are important as the film progresses. For them, it is the key to knowing where and who they are."", """", ""More than anything, Coherence shows serious ambition. For this to be Byrkit's debut is an absolute wonder. It is not perfect by any means and probably gets too caught up in philosophy and quantum physics to be truly accessible or perfect. That said, a more experienced director would have problems keeping this one under wraps and having it somehow stay coherent. Instead, many would let the film got bogged down within itself and make no sense in the end. For Byrkit, however, things remain oddly linear. Who we are watching is unbeknownst to us, yet everything is the same and the viewer is able to follow the plot without nary a hitch. As Byrkit adds more and more layers to this film, things remain within our grasp and the film never feels like it is too much. It never feels silly. Instead, this air of paranoia and confusion runs rampant and truly arrests the viewer."", """", ""Showcasing serious potential for James Ward Byrkit in the director's chair, this mindbending film is a terrifying, atmospheric, somehow coherent, and truly original science fiction film. It is a rarity nowadays to say that, but it is the absolute truth. In creating this original film, Byrkit was incredibly ambitious and trusting of his audience to follow him wherever he opted to go. The end result is a truly engrossing experience that - for lovers of science fiction - will pay off in spades."" ]";5

Hilarious, touching, and fantastically musical, the film is a wonderfully entertaining take on the fairy tales of old and their worlds, while adding in a nice twist with the trademark moral of the story. First off, the music is fantastic. Both the musical sequences and score are beautiful and sung perfectly. The acting from Anna Kendrick, Emily Blunt, and Meryl Streep, is very good. Additionally, the direction from Rob Marshall is very good. Without it, this film would have been DOA due to the mashup of various stories. The pacing is good, though it can be a touch frenetic in the beginning, but it was far from detrimental. The script is good and really does a good job balancing everything. The cinematography and special effects are great and capture some seriously beautiful shots together. Into the Woods can also be truly hysterical as it gleefully makes fun of musicals and the fairy tales it incorporates. However, the piece I loved the most was the ruminations on life (and the dangers hidden within), love, loss, grieving, and parenthood. This is where the film is a home run success and truly becomes a major success. Into the Woods can be weird at times and it requires a willingness from the audience to go along with it, but on the whole, it is a funny and truly emotionally moving musical that has fantastic music to go along with it."" ]";5

The direction from David Ayer was great here and the war/action sequences were expertly put together. Ayer has a knack for some real great action sequences and Fury is no exception to that. Brad Pitt, Shia Labeouf, Michael Pena, and especially Logan Lerman, were all stellar in their respective roles. The costume design and makeup in the film were also very great as these men look the part and look war battered. However, where Fury is the most successful is in the realism. Incredibly faithful to reality, the film feels authentic, especially when it comes to the blood and gore of war. As a whole, Fury is no Saving Private Ryan, but is definitely the best war film in a while and stands as a very good film in what was a great year for film in 2014."" ]";5

Featuring brilliant imagery and a great score to couple good direction from James Marsh and a terrific performance from Eddie Redmayne, the film has quite the good report card. A good biopic on Hawking, the film also manages to be a phenomenal romance film with some elements of period pieces involved in it as well. Additionally, the costume and production design are very good, as is the sequence of Hawking's decline. Each stage is appropriately handled and given its due weight. Though I do not care for the man, he is undeniably brilliant and this shines through in the film and you feel a sort of sense of awe watching his mind work. Overall, The Theory of Everything is not a great film, but it is very close and was very much deserving of its recognition as such."" ]";5
1079;honeymoon;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""I actually really liked Honeymoon. The directorial debut of Leigh Janiak, Honeymoon is a tense, chilling little indie horror flick with adequate performances from Rose Leslie and Harry Treadaway. The film is deeply influenced by both science fiction and more demonic possession type horror films (think Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, etc.) and is not completely original, but does play around with both of these two leave you really questioning what actually happened at the end. This ambiguous ending will not work for everyone, but it really worked for me and really heightened my enjoyment of it because of the various clues left for any explanation. Overall, Janiak demonstrates a very good understanding of genre conventions and how to make a satisfyingly slow building horror film with great atmosphere and thoroughly entertaining chills."" ]";5
1080;whiplash;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Damn is this one intense. Throughout, this one makes you feel as though you are the one being screamed at and belittled. Wow. Stellar direction from Damien Chazelle, insane to think that this is his directorial debut. The sky is the limit for this wonderful talent. The writing is strong and wherever it stalls or the story stalls, the direction is strong enough to make up for it. Though, what really makes this film is the acting. Miles  Teller and JK Simmons are MARVELOUS. I really wish the studio was able to campaign for both of them, because Teller deserved recognition for this role as well, though I am glad that Simmons rightfully received numerous accolades. Teller has a bright future ahead of him if this and The Spectacular Now are any indication, as he was brilliant. I never expected a film about orchestra to be as harrowing and intense as this, but man oh man does Whiplash ever keep you on the edge of your seat. The interactions between Teller and Simmons rival that of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs, that is how intense and well done they are, as that is my favorite film of all-time."", """", ""What prevents me from giving this one a higher rating, however, is that you can tell this was a short film stretched out to feature length. While stuff added certainly adds to the overall film, the odd romantic element served little-to-no purpose and any development could have been achieved elsewhere. In addition, even his relationship with his father felt like filler to add to the run time. This film is about a kid who plays drums who wants to be great and his overly intense teacher. If the film had stayed a bit more focused in that regard, I would have given it a higher rating. As it stands though, Whiplash is a terrific film that displays the talents of both Miles Teller and JK Simmons, while also establishing Damien Chazelle as a director to keep an eye on."" ]";5

It did not show just all the success and positivity he had, but it also showed the negative elements of him and his life and, overall, felt very complete and well done. The storytelling could have been a little better (it kept jumping around in time throughout), but the direction was strong for the most part and felt very focused. The soundtrack is also great, as expected. The acting from all is also good, however, the real superstar here is Chadwick Boseman. In a true Oscar nomination-worthy performance, Boseman really embodies Brown to a t and really brings the \""funk\"" and \""groove\"" in his performance and his dance moves. This was a true powerhouse performance from an actor who is clearly somebody on the rise. At the end of the day, it is a biopic and it is hard to cover everything in a person's life in a 2 hour+ time frame, but I think this one did pretty well (even if it did jump around and gloss over some things) and, as I said, felt very fair. But, this one will be remembered as the film that made Boseman into a star, more so than for any other element of it."" ]";5
1082;gone-girl;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Damn, Gone Girl really ropes you in and does not let go until the final bell tolls, which is very impressive for a film that is two and a half hours long. At really no point does it lag and while it is certainly very slow at times, it never becomes boring and leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat for much of it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are stellar here, as are Neil Patrick Harris and (oddly) Tyler Perry. The cast, on paper, seemed odd, but in practice, David Fincher shows why he is one of the best around and got the best out of everybody. The general feel and mood of the film is also brilliant and entirely chilling. However, beyond the whole murder mystery type deal, the most interesting part to me here was the total indictment of the media and the 24 hour news cycle, which Fincher does a great job showcasing throughout and how the media will believe just about anything and then jump to conclusions based off of what small information they may have. The twists and turns here are also very interesting and the script from Gillian Flynn is very strong. The way the story was told at times was odd, but that would be my only complaint really and it was nothing major. As a whole, this is certanly not Fincher's best work (Seven, Fight Club, and Zodiac, would be my top three from him), but it is certainly not his worst (excluding Alien 3) and is overall, a very well made, well acted thriller that will leave you wanting more. Would be surprised if Affleck and Pike are not major contenders at the Oscars."" ]";5

Combined, they manage to borderline scare you, while also thrilling you with some killer action sequences and numerous twists and turns that both reveal and confuse things further. Dan Stevens is fantastic in the lead role, while Maika Monroe turns in a supporting performance that provides further proof of her brilliance. This film really manages to heighten suspense throughout and has a chilling coolness that both pulls you in and scares you that really underscores how cold and calculated everything done in the film is. In addition, the film is also really shot and has some great production design and the final act as a whole is brilliant and wraps the film up brilliantly. Overall, The Guest is a very good film that deserves far more attention than it has received."" ]";5
1084;happy-christmas;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""I quite enjoyed Happy Christmas. A nice and enjoyable slice of life film, it is a captivating character study of a self-destructive, immature young man who desperately needs to grow up. Anna Kendrick perfectly emulates this type of person here, while Joe Swanberg and Melanie Lynskey also turn in good performances. The writing and direction here are solid and the film has good pacing with an interesting story to tell. I love slice of life films and this is no exception, though it does feel a touch incomplete. It needed to be longer than 82 minutes, just to give these characters more depth and more time to do things. Unfortunately, that is not the case and I would point to that as the film's main weakness. Otherwise, however, it is an enjoyable dramedy with good acting and compelling characters."" ]";5
1085;begin-again;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Overall, this one feels a bit magical and is quite heart warming. Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo are great and their chemistry with one another feels authentic. Hailee Steinfeld is also good in a supporting role here. Adam Levine, at times, shows his inexperience in acting and is severely outclassed, but never really seems like dead weight either. The characters are well put together, the story is told well, and as I just said, the overall experience is a feel good one. Nothing really overly unique and great about the film as a whole, but it works for what it is. However, the one area where the film is phenomenal is in its music. The songs in the film are magical and really click every single time. Watching them record them and then hearing the final product is a fun and enjoyable thing to see and to see them come together and express themselves doing so is another nice touch. Really, everything to do with the music here is pitch perfect."" ]";5
1086;cold-in-july;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Cold in July is a fantastic crime thriller from director Jim Mickie with outstanding performances from Michael C. Hall and Sam Shephard. Mickie does a great job wringing tension out of the premise and the end result is that the viewer is constantly on pins and needles awaiting the next twist the film is going to take. Once you think you have a grasp on where the film is headed, it frequently pulls the rug out from under you and changes course yet again. The film is incredibly detailed, right down to the different filters on the film, which transition from blue to gold to red in the film. It is really the defining factor in why this film has really fantastic look. The cinematography ain't too shabby either though. Overall, Cold in July is not perfect, but it is the exact kind of film that crime thriller fans are looking for and, beyond that, it is incredibly well crafted and is one that will definitely stick with you for a bit."" ]";5
1087;chef;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Overall, this effort from Jon Favreau is a heart warming, touching, and loaded with charm. For the most part, Chef is a relatively straightforward film with good comedic elements blended with good dramatic elements, which combine to produce a pretty good film. Not world beating by any means, but it is undoubtedly endlessly enjoyable and fun for the whole family. In terms of acting, John Leguizamo has a great charismatic performance in support here and really is the bright star in this bunch. For a child actor, EmJay Anthony is also good and never really sticks out like a sore thumb. The kid was entirely convincing. Jon Favreau was fine in the lead role as well, he made you like him right away and while he may not be my first choice, it worked well overall. Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. also had good, though small, roles here. Now, I do not know if I can buy that Favreau dates Johansson and used to be married to Sofia Vergara here, but since the guy wrote, directed, and acted in this one, I can appreciate the dream, haha."" ]";5
1088;the-rover;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The Rover comes with its share of positives and negatives, but ultimately, its positives are too good to ignore. However, starting with the negative side of things, the story is lackluster. I am not always somebody who demands clarity from a story, but here, it would have been nice to at least have heard the main character's name once. That is how little information this one gives you as to what is going on, which really goes to the larger problem of a largely pretty poor story. The writing is alright, but the story is lackluster and really did very little for me. In saying that, this one's positives are really positive. Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson are outstanding in this one and really do everything humanly possible to make this one into a good movie and dammit, they certainly did. Director David Michod is great as always, he really created a very cool dark, gritty, and dystopian, world here that I wish was fleshed out a bit more, but ultimately, his direction was great as always. The cinematography was also pitch perfect and really helped add a super clean and interesting look to this world created by Michod. Overall, The Rover is a good, entertaining film that is undoubtedly a bit of a slow burner, but if you appreciate great acting and direction over anything, this is the one for you."" ]";5
1089;ida;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Technically brilliant, Ida is truly a picture in motion and that image is absolutely gorgeous. Throughout, it is wonderfully beautiful and moving with great performances, brilliant writing, inspired direction, and fantastic cinematography. I cannot say I have ever seen a Polish film, but this is certainly one of the better foreign films I have seen and I am elated it got the level of praise it did. Truly, this film feels important and brilliant. However, what does hold this one back is it feels distant. While interesting and compelling, it is never quite as engaging as one would typically ask of a film. Truly a marvelous art piece of a film, Ida is in many ways a great post-war film, a great religious film, and a brilliant tragedy. However, what it truly is a great rendition of: it is a great journey for self. Ida is about a girl who is out to discover who she is and her family's history and this film does a great job telling this tale. A brilliant work from Poland, Ida may not be as engaging as some would like, but it is undeniably fantastic filmmaking."" ]";5
1090;the-railway-man;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The Railway Man can be timid and poorly paced at times, but is ultimately an emotionally charged film that really treads interesting and worthwhile territory when it comes to PTSD, WWII, and forgiveness. In particular, the ending of the film is expertly done and really pays off on all of the emotion built up from the rest of the film. Colin Firth, Jeremy Irvine, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Tanroh Ishida, all shine in this film directed by Jonathan Teplitzky. The film is not poorly directed at all, though the pacing does slack at times, which is problematic. The cinematography is very good and the transition between WWII Japan and 1980s England is handled very well and never winds up being confusing when things change. As an overall film, The Railway Man feels too subtle at times which does hurt the final product, but is still a very well made and incredibly well acted film about forgiveness."" ]";5
1091;filth;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Filth is a tough film to watch. Focusing in on a man who is deeply unhappy with himself and drowns himself in booze, drugs, women, and terrorizing people in his line of work, Filth is a decidedly filthy experience. Its raw and depressing look at the life of a broken man who sees hallucinations and is haunted by the wrongs he attributes to himself, Filth is never overly welcoming. Its protagonist is brash, brutal, and confrontational as he takes his anger out on a world that he feels has wronged him and focuses in on areas that he hates about himself. It is out of this hurt and hatred for the world and himself that a man such as Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy) is born. Vying for a promotion to Detective Inspector, Bruce is put on a murder case where a Japanese boy is killed and tasked with solving a case in which a man's wife is being harassed by a sexual predator on the phone. The latter of which is obviously Bruce, but nobody can know that, right? Taking aim at his co-workers who also aim to be promoted, Bruce is in direct competition mainly with Ray Lennox (Jamie Bell) - who he does drugs with and has even engaged in a threesome with - and Amanda Drummond (Imogen Poots) - a good natured woman who is incredibly knowledgeable and on the rise. He also spits vitriol at his various co-workers for having what he does not: an embracing of who they are, a wife, kids, or for simply being a woman. Though married, and we do see his wife Carole Richardson (Shauna Macdonald) from the very beginning, it quickly becomes clear that Bruce is no longer married. From the dreamy way in which Carole's scenes are shot to Bruce's isolation at all times, he may lie that she and his daughter Stacey are still around, but he is actually alone. He tries to fill his time with various women and drugs, neither of which actually fulfill him and only serve to send him further and further down into his spiral of self-hate."", ""That said, its approach to this story is undoubtedly quite abrasive. It is a film that dares you to hate it and its protagonist. In many ways, this is emblematic of its protagonist. Once a good man, he clutches onto a woman who still considers him to be good due to his heroic actions. That one scene, where he provides CPR to a collapsed man, speaks to this good nature. Yet, as he has lost his wife, children, has repressed homosexuality, sleeps around, treats people like garbage, and does drugs, he feels as though he is \""filth\"". He wants that affirmation from that world that he is \""filth\"", in order to satisfy his own thought process. Those who see him as a good man are rare and, deep down, his soul craves people to recognize the good in him. Yet, no matter where he goes, the ugly inner hatred in him stirs back up and washes away any desire to be loved, as he is filth and should be seen as such. Thus, his -  and the film's - abrasive nature is the embodiment of this. It wants you to hate him and it because it depicts a cruel and wicked man. It dares you to see past that and find the good side of him and realize he is actually a sympathetic man, tormented by his past mistakes and things he blames himself for."", ""The film does present some issues beyond its inherent bleakness and lack of redemption for its character. This main issue is a lack of development of Bruce's background. It sprinkles in elements and we begin to understand how he became this way, but it seems as though it almost happened on a dime. There is a lack of understanding as to where his wife went, how an issue from some long ago could just pop up after him being a good man for so long, and who the mysterious doctor he encourages is and what he does for him. The film writes these off as hallucinations and many would probably find this information trivial, as we understand he is broken. Why does the how matter? Yet, it certainly does matter where we see this man just spiral down into a fit of hatred with no high point. He just goes lower and lower. There is no balance to this character study. He just gets progressively lower and even more irredeemable at every point in this film. Though there are a few glimpses at his softer side, they are quickly drowned out in sorrow. What could have bolstered this is more comedy, but this film's brand of black comedy never really appealed to me too much and largely left a lot to be desired."", ""That said, this is a passionately told character study that, though it is overly depressing, is quite well-written with an excellent turn from James McAvoy in the lead role. Playing a cruel and wicked man who became that way from self-hatred, Filth is a sad and brutally bleak hour and a half. Though it never really brightens things up or provides proper context for his self-hatred, it is still a highly compelling character study of a pure antihero that winds up being quite heartbreaking when we see what he has been hiding within himself all these years."" ]";5
1092;only-lovers-left-alive;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Only Lovers Left Alive is a truly unique and thoroughly odd entry to the vampire subgenre. Honestly, it is barely a vampire film and is far more of a drama, romance, and thriller. Compelling to the very last drop, Only Lovers Left Alive also serves as a compelling take on musicians, Detroit, the downturn in the economy, science, and famous writers. Together, Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton are phenomenal and have deliciously odd chemistry with one another. Director Jim Jarmusch does a typically great job at handling this odd vampire film that is very nicely paced and incredibly well crafted. Honestly, however, my favorite piece here is the look and style. Incredibly stylish, Only Lovers Left Alive has phenomenal cinematography (especially the lighting) is absolutely phenomenal. The music really accents this style perfectly with this deeply unsettling and laid back musical score for the film. Overall, Only Lovers Left Alive is a thoroughly odd film, but is a truly marvelous work that soars on the back of all its talented creators."" ]";5
1093;blue-ruin;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Blue Ruin is a film that cements director Jeremy Saulnier as a talent to keep an eye on. Brilliantly directed, executed, and paced, Blue Ruin is a definite success. Macon Blair shines in the lead role and truly commands the screen and does a great job portraying this broken character. Saulnier never fails to amp up the tension here either, as you are constantly on the edge of your seat here as the violence and unfolds. In addition, in just an hour and a half, the film does a great job developing all characters and plot elements to where it feels as though you truly have a grasp on everything that is happening in the film. As a whole, I went into this one expecting a good film and, luckily, that is exactly what I got in return. It is always a nice thing when a film lives up to expectations. The only negative I would mention here is the violence can be gratuitous at times and really took me out of the film in those moments. However, there are not many of those moments thankfully."" ]";5
1094;locke;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Locke is pure brilliance in motion. An emotionally powerful and stirring film, Locke really hits home and the struggles our protagonist faces are so incredibly real that it makes you feel serious compassion for him while also hating his guts at the same time. Tom Hardy does brilliantly to capture this element and really turns in a powerhouse of a performance. The direction from Steven Knight is fantastic, as is the writing which perfectly captures Locke as a person, as well as everyone he talks to on the phone. Though Locke is the only one we ever see, the people on the other end are so well crafted that seeing is not believing here. You get their full emotion and passion through just the phone calls, which is truly impressive. The cinematography here is gorgeous and really does well to capture the claustrophobic setting and feeling of the film, while also just being simply gorgeous at the same time. Overall, Locke is a phenomenal piece of film that showcases both Hardy's acting skill and Knight's skill as a storyteller. This film is something else."" ]";5

Boy was I wrong. I swear I never expected this one to be the one to make me cry, but here I am, listening to the soundtrack and it is still making me feel something I have not felt in a while. Shailene Woodley continues to convince me in this one that she is the next huge film actress, while this one also served as a great way for Ansel Elgort to introduce himself to me, because his acting is also incredible here. Though about kids with cancer, the tearjerking moments never feel as though they are relying solely on that, because there is just so much more to this film. Truly just beautiful in every way imaginable, The Fault in Our Stars shattered my expectations. The script, written by two of my favorite writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, is great. I cannot compare it to the book, but all the same, the script is perfect. It is amazing how this film can truly make you feel something for every character, as it really does not have any one dimensional characters. They are all multi-faceted in their own way and that is really what helps this one hit me in the way it has. I would also be remiss if I did not mention how good Nat Wolff, Laura Dern, and Willem Dafoe were in their supporting roles. Truly impressive stuff all-around. I love surprises like this."" ]";5

Smart and impeccably well crafted, this installment's first half is a little weak at times, but the second half is unmatched in recent times from war films. Honestly, this and its first installment have to be some of the best war films of this decade and up there for this century as a whole. Director Matt Reeves picks up where Rupert Wyatt left off with a beautifully poetic and stunningly crafted film about Caesar and the apes. Mirroring foreign politics on the brink of war in real life, all of those same problems and confusions are represented here with a deeply human and moving film the result. Neither side is good, neither side is bad. Instead, it is one big shade of gray with plenty of confusion on both sides. The cinematography and score are once more incredible. The special effects are fantastic and the fight choreography incredibly impressive. Many modern day blockbusters lack weight and an air of importance and \""epicness\"". This one has it all in spades with a truly incredible film that packs a true emotional punch due to the trauma that can come from misunderstandings.

I love films that leave you wondering, \""What the hell did I just watch?\"" and this one fits the bill to a t. Jake Gyllenhaal is phenomenal here as Adam Bell and Anthony Claire. He plays these two different, but very similar men brilliantly and is able to switch between the two at the drop of a hat, which is really cool to watch. In addition, it is gorgeously filmed. I loved the lighting at night and, on top of that, the shots during the day are also very beautiful. It truly is eye candy. It also functions great as a psychological thriller as, even though it slow going in the beginning, when it kicks into high gear, you are left wondering \""Wtf wtf wtf wtf\"" as events unfold. This was one of my most anticipated films of 2014 and now that I have finally been able to see it, it does not disappoint at all.

Absolutely terrifying, Oculus takes an interesting premise and knocks it out of the park thanks to strong writing, direction, special effects, and acting. It can get a little silly at times, but horror movies of this kind require some kind of \""leap of faith\"" and while you can easily poke holes in a lot of things, it kind of defeats the purpose of watching the movie. Ultimately, horror is supposed to scare you and this one delivers those scares, as well as a killer mood that really sucks you in with a sense of dread that is evident throughout. I also hate gore, so I am glad this one had little to no gore and instead tried to scare you through its mood and effects, which is what I prefer. As a whole, I am not sure why the audience was so lukewarm to this one, since I found it really entertaining and quite well made. Overall, Oculus is a fun watch that couples scares with good production elements to make the ideal film."" ]";5

The cast is fantastic, led by George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Cate Blanchett, and Bob Balaban. The story is also very interesting as this group of misfits try to recover art stolen by the Nazis. It is surprisingly funny at times, which I did not expect and there are plenty of thrills and exciting moments. I never really found it boring, though it was of a slower nature, but for me, I was always interested. The whole point here is to argue about the worth of art in a caper film about stealing it back, so that way it can be preserved and displayed by their rightful owners. Ultimately, if you truly do not care about art, you will be left wondering why these idiots are almost getting killed trying to get it back, but if you, at the very least, respect the work of the artists, you will get what is so important. Now, I have heard a lot of debate over its actual historical accuracy, but to me, that is irrelevant. It is, at least somewhat, based on real situations and a real group of people sent to try to preserve art, but made more exciting and funny. You do not hear anybody giving a negative review to Braveheart for not being historically accurate, so I do not understand the different treatment for this one. As a whole, The Monuments Men is a well made, well acted, and well directed film that in lesser hands, could have been worse."" ]";5
1100;noah;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Talk about divisive, haha. Though, I think much of the divisiveness surrounding this one is due to many religious folk walking in and expecting a re-enactment of the Bible word-for-word with no added elements and no alteration of anything. Even as a Christian, I realize how stupid that demand is. As a whole, I largely enjoyed Noah. The performances from Russell Crowe, Ray Winstone, and Emma Watson, are all very good. Jennifer Connelly is also alright (though there is one scene where she struggled pretty badly). I also enjoyed many of the added elements, such as the Watchers (the rock creatures). They received the most criticism from hardcore Christians, but for me, I loved what they added to the film and their journey was just as riveting as that of Noah. Up until the flood, this film is brilliant. Post-flood, however, things begin to follow apart (while I liked Winstone's acting, I don't like his character being added and it all felt so cliche). However, it does pick back up again towards the end and convinces me there is brilliance in this somewhat broken film. The cinematography is very consistently beautiful. Some of the shots here are absolutely gorgeous (by some I mean the vast majority). The direction from Darren Aronofsky is also characteristically strong here and while this may not be my favorite film by him, it is still a great example of his talent. Overall, Noah is far from perfect, but is a solid film that does not try to be a Bible film, so do not come expecting that. Rather, it is more along the line of apocalyptic epic,"" ]";5

Now on a quest to find her son with journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), Philomena is a truly affirmative, moving, and well-constructed true story."", """", ""Often times true stories can slack a bit in terms of pace and interest, simply because you can see the way in which the director is constrained and forced to stay to the story. Philomena certainly does not showcase any of this. Instead, director Stephen Frears ably handles this true story that is interesting in its own right, but he does a great job wringing the drama and emotion out of this. As a result, Philomena is not just a film that tells a story of a mother looking for her son. Instead, it is a universal tale of journey and discovery for both Philomena and Sixsmith and a film that has a heart. There is a heart and soul to this film as it passionately tells this tale of injustice."", """", ""With truly brilliant performances from Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, Philomena further convinces me that I need to see more of Steve Coogan. I have only seen him sporadically, but that is clearly not enough. Together, they have terrific chemistry and they work together to find Philomena's son and find out what happened to him after 50 years. Dench plays Philomena with incredible class and majesty, as is to be expected for a woman with such dignity and prowess. The scene in which Philomena forgives Sister Hildegard for all of her sins against Philomena is incredibly powerful. The way in which she can forgive someone who wronged her so much is something that we all could learn from. Dench plays the scene to perfection with incredible emotion, yet with equal strength."", """", ""The film does a great job not just making me fight back tears, but also dramatically. As the duo try to uncover the mystery, the film is packed to the brim with drama, furthered by the hurdles they must overcome in order to discover the truth. Though cliched in spots in this regard, Frears does a good job executing the cliches and still manages to make it damn near thrilling as they sort through the evidence and find her son. Above all, however, the film is truly emotional, particularly the ending and when Martin discovers the truth about Philomena's son.

Funny, enchanting, and impeccably shot, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is an incredibly feel good film that hits some really good highs, but waters them down with major problems. First off, the writing is solid. Though the characters other than Walter Mitty suck, Mitty's arc is well done and since the film is about him, this fact makes sense. A journey of self-discovery, the film really makes you want to get up and go travel, which speaks to its impact it can have on a viewer. Additionally, the cinematography is very good and really soaks up the beauty of its idyllic shooting locations. However, on the flip side, the film can fall flat at times. In particular, it hits the brakes whenever Mitty has a dream sequence with those moments being outlandish, weird, and unnecessary. Overall, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a sweet ode to life itself and those who go unnoticed, but is not nearly as successful at its premise as it should have been."" ]";5

1104;saving-mr-banks;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Sentimental and sugary sweet to the very last drop, director John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks may not reinvent the wheel, but is pure crowd pleasing entertainment that hits on all the right notes. It will make you cry. It will make you laugh. It will make you feel. Yes, there are visible manipulative strings being pulled by a sinister mouse standing in the background and P.L. Travers undoubtedly turns over in her grave every time somebody watches the film, but dammit, it is very pleasant cinema. While Hancock may pull a bit too tightly on the audience's heart strings to the point that it causes physical pain. Yet, his touches are so sweet and nice, it is hard not to just give into the simple pleasure of the film. I know that films of this type are hated to the point that they get wildly popular 1/2 star reviews on the internet where the reviewer just trashes Disney and lists adjectives as to how the movie is bad, but I really could not care. Saving Mr. Banks is a nice little film may not be a masterpiece, but delivers everything a movie should: joy, laughter, and tears."", ""Telling the story of how Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) convinced P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to give Disney the rights to Mary Poppins, the film undoubtedly takes various liberties with the true story in the name of entertainment, but that is neither her nor there. Throughout the process, Travers is quite hesitant. She openly hates every idea Disney and his colleagues offer up, rejects the idea of a musical, and bans red from being in the film. She is eccentric, frightfully British, and incredibly manic. Focusing mostly on Travers and showing her life in Australia with her parents, especially her beloved but alcoholic father Travers Goff (Colin Farrell), it quickly becomes clear why she is hesitant to give up Mary Poppins: the story is her life. To give it up is to move on from that point of her life and to finally let go of her father and forgive herself after all of these years."", ""The scenes of the making of Mary Poppins are classic \""movie about movies\"" material and, as always, this plays out quite well in my eyes. I am a sucker for movies about movies and this one is absolutely not an exception. The process of getting the rights to the novel and creating every bit of a movie I have never even seen is positively riveting to me and Saving Mr. Banks aces it throughout. The film's more manipulative parts, its flashbacks with Colin Farrell lushly riding off into the sunset on a white horse, still do play well. They may be a bit cloying and drastically overly sentimental, but it provides great development for Travers and shows why she is behaving the way she is with the creators of the Mary Poppins movie. It provides context for the inspiration for each character and why she holds onto them so dearly. The scenes may be a bit too much, a real trait of Hancock's, but their nostalgia and depiction of trauma and how one reacts to it is rather beautiful. Each tear is well-earned and though sentimental and sweet, the scenes work due to the installation of a sense of wonder and imagination that really brings the old school movie magic the film tries to create."", ""Emma Thompson, as P.L. Travers, shows why she is a cinematic treasure. Brilliantly displaying her regret and hesitation at signing Mary Poppins away due to what she represents to her, Thompson equally plays her controlling and intensely witty nature. Much of the film's comedy comes from the mouth of Thompson with zippy and smart lines rolling off of her tongue with ease. Playing off of Hanks' steely, bubbly, and determined Walt Disney, Thompson's seemingly oblivious and demanding Travers who seeks to push Disney away from her beloved property through innocuous demands and pushing them too far, really works well. Together, they occasionally make you laugh, but mostly deliver the drama of the film. Again, this drama is a bit sentimental and dripping in nostalgia, but comes out on top because of the excellent chemistry between Thompson and Hanks in these moments."", ""Unlikely to convince haters of John Lee Hancock's brand of sentimental cinema, but hardly worthy of the vitriol some online reviewers throw at it, Saving Mr. Banks is a touching tale of a woman trying to save her work. While she eventually gives in and is willing to share her creation with the world, she must first forgive herself and end her grieving over her beloved father. Funny, charming, pleasant, and melancholy, Saving Mr. Banks plays the audience's emotions like a violin and while it may play a bit rough, the film's overwhelming pleasant nature wins out in the end and makes this one an absolute joy to watch."" ]";5

I loved the animation technique and the voice acting from everyone is great, in particular Will Arnett as Batman, who is hilarious. I like all the references to different elements from Lego and different elements of the characters they portray. It really added to the humor and made the ride all the more enjoyable.

The music is also very good here and the fact that they are also results of the actors actually singing them is all the more impressive. The cinematography here is also splendid and I, in particular, really enjoyed the slight blue filter. It really captures the mood well and it simply looks really good and gives this one a distinctive look. The plot is simplistic, but very interesting and it feels entirely authentic to the times and the life lived by musicians at the time.

1108;the-counselor;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The Counselor is a verbose, overstuffed, yet disastrously terrific work from Ridley Scott. Densely written by Cormac McCarthy, The Counselor shows that McCarthy was not willing to compromise his style in translating it to the screen. With SAT words aplenty, McCarthy's script is alien with characters forced to say lines that no human being in these situations would ever dream of actually speaking. However, in doing so, McCarthy sets up The Counselor to be a film that is not some crime drama, but instead a poetic and mythical film that hardly bears any resemblance to reality. That said, this language - as it is in his novels - is beautiful to hear. Though it is this language that undeniably contributes to the film's divisiveness, it is also its problems with apparent filler and its incoherent narrative. What is not for debate, however, is the brilliance of the acting. They take this messy material and turn it into a chaotically beautiful work that, though flawed, will likely become a favorite of cinephiles for years to come for the very flaws that it has."", ""The Counselor's message is clear and brought forth by Cameron Diaz at the very end. Those who are cowards will be eaten by the predators in this world. In the world created by Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthy, the predators are the cartel. Brutal and unrelenting, they kill with an odd sort of beauty that turns murder and maiming into a sort of art. It is with this in mind that the film approaches its subjects. Led by the Counselor (Michael Fassbender), a smart and capable lawyer distracted by greed to become richer, he is undoubtedly a coward. He may pretend to be ready to help run drugs into the country with the help of Reiner (Javier Bardem) and Westray (Brad Pitt), but he is not. He is more content with living and loving his fiancee Laura (Penelope Cruz). However, he enters the game anyways and quickly gets bitten by his cowardice. Afraid and unaware of his situation, the Counselor is effectively a jackrabbit that does not know a cheetah is creeping up behind it ever so slowly. Instead, he is forced to live in agony as he waits for what is around the corner. By the time he figures out death is approaching him, it has become an inevitability. Fassbender plays this deer in the headlights type of role incredibly well, as always, but his terrific performance is certainly matched by Bardem. Extravagant and certainly an odd guy, Bardem plays the role perfectly for the character."", ""The film is stolen, however, by the performance of Cameron Diaz. A career-best performance, her cold and calculating Malkina is the predator. The lover of Reiner, who owns two cheetahs, Malkina herself has a cheetah spotting tattoo that runs down the length of her body. Intensely sexual, Malkina herself links sensuality with the beauty of a predator stalking its prey and she herself defines this characteristic. Her sexual behavior is animalistic and unhinged, designed to scare the cowardice out of her mates. When stalking her prey, she is efficient and smart. While the cartels loom, Malkina is unafraid and hell-bent on securing her own desires. In this role, Diaz is oddly intimidating. She plays the role of the sexed up villain incredibly well with an ability to make any situation uncomfortable for those around her."", ""Yet, the film is flawed. With scenes one could chalk up as filler, such as those with John Leguizamo and Dean Norris, as well as one where Cameron Diaz goes to church, The Counselor is certainly not tight. It is often unfocused and diverting. A slow-burn, The Counselor pays off those willing to wait for it to find itself, but for those unwilling, The Counselor will be a major turn off. However, there is beauty in these flaws. Where the film bloats, it allows for characters to become more developed. Where the film is slow and meandering, it is an excuse for McCarthy to pen gorgeous dialogue as only he can and is an excuse to spend more time in this world. Here, the film truly becomes a diamond, which is a major element of the film. As told to the Counselor (Fassbender's character) by a Dutch diamond dealer (Bruno Ganz), the more flawed diamonds have a far higher value due to those flaws and imperfections. This is the case for the film itself as its flaws make oddly make it more beautiful than it could be if it were perfect. What certainly does not hurt this beauty either is the cinematography. Capitalizing on the beautiful people, set designs, and the spacious desert, The Counselor is an absolutely beautiful film to look at all times and is visually engrossing in this regard."", ""A slow burn thriller, The Counselor is a convoluted and confusing film, but at its very core, it is simply a film about hunters closing in on its prey. What makes it a very good film, however, is McCarthy's script. Here, McCarthy finds poetry in the chaos on screen and brings out the beauty and artistry of the hunt. As with the hunt, the film is intensely beautiful and sexual, with McCarthy"" ]";5

Featuring stellar performances from Brie Larson, John Gallagher, Kaitlyn Dever, Keith Stanfield, and the entire cast, Short Term 12 is an emotionally powerful film about a group home for teenagers with extremely troubled pasts. Respectful about its subjects, the film's characters show incredible depth and the way they are able to dissect and reveal so much about this many characters in just an hour and a half run time is impeccable. It is easy to tell how well written this film is because its characters feel like people you know. You could see them just walking down the street, they are just so real.

As I said, everything here felt authentic and that was in large part thanks to their acting. They all played the roles of high school seniors heading into the rest of their lives very well. The direction is also great and feels very focused.

Their transformations are amazing and the acting is great, do not get me wrong, but it is certainly not McConaughey or Leto's best performance. To me, McConaughey was better in Mud, Killer Joe, and (later) True Detective. Leto was better in Requiem for a Dream and Mr. Nobody. However, both were great here and deserved their Oscars, if not just for this film, but for their body of work. Jennifer Garner is also good here, though she somehow managed to fly under the radar for many. The biographical elements here are solid and the film itself is a alright, but certainly not anything great. What really makes this one click is the aforementioned acting from McConaughey and Leto.

In addition, the sound mixing on this one is out of this world good. Now, what holds back Godzilla? It is a Godzilla movie, so it would have nice to see more attention paid to him than the other monsters. I love his amount of screen time, but he does not dominate that screen time in any way. Additionally, it is a popcorn flick. Inherently, it feels formulaic and too predictable.

Overall, it does a really good job creating tension and a scary atmosphere thanks to the good direction from Adam Wingard.

The action sequences were also brilliantly filmed, thanks to the phenomenal special effects prevalent in everything they did. The film certainly had a really cool look and the special effects were top-notch. Above all, the film was just as exciting as the book. Sure, you could say it was just kids playing video games, but then you would miss all the moral questions about war and what they were doing with these kids. It was all more than just a game. On the negative, while I enjoyed that they tried to work in everything from the book, it all kind of felt like a tl;dr version of the book. The movie was also as if they just skimmed the book and included all the highlights, which I felt cheapened the project. I would have preferred them to either make the movie longer or cut some stuff out entirely and spend more time with other stuff, which would help slow down the pace of the film (which was a problem) and add more depth in certain areas, rather than brief snapshots of a lot of things. Finally, the acting was laughably bad at times. As a whole, it was not terrible, but as is the territory with younger actors, there were some definite stumbles at times, though none of the adults were fantastic either.

It is quite over the top and hard-hitting, sometimes to degrees where it becomes like, \""Oh come on,\"" but regardless, it is endlessly watchable. DiCaprio did great as expected and is undoubtably the reason why I sort of aligned myself with Belfort in spite of his horrendous acts of disregard and debauchery throughout.

1119;passion;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""As with many of Brian De Palma's films - especially those released in the 21st Century - Passion was, well, divisive upon release. A remake of a French film, many critics derided this one as self-indulgent, trashy, and an imitation of De Palma's own work. While admittedly a bit self-indulgent and poorly plotted, Passion is just so much fun to experience and to see, it is hard not to champion it as unfairly maligned. Sure, it is exclusively style over substance, but never has style looked so good as in De Palma's Passion. Toying with ideas he has introduced before, Passion is a film about manipulation, power, dominance, and sex. Even more, it continues to show how influenced by Hitchcock this man is with a focus towards the end of pulling of the \""perfect murder\"". A major theme in some of Hitchcock's works such as Shadow of a Doubt and Dial M for Murder, the same appears in this film. Even better, many of De Palma's trademark shots, such as split screens and oblique angles make triumphant appearances in this film. Maybe this one is not for everybody, but since I happen to love the work of De Palma, I ate this one up with a spoon."", ""One of the best elements of this film is how it crafts its perfect murder. Not revealing its tricks until the very end, even the audience is fooled in this one as De Palma uses his split-screen to manipulate and confuse the audience. On one side, we see Isabelle James (Noomi Rapace) at the ballet. On the other, we see Christine Stanford (Rachel McAdams) at home. The split-screen in this film is particularly great as Isabelle's side slides onto the frame and Christine's slides off and then back on. As magnificently choreographed as always, De Palma adds another wrinkle by using voyeurism in Christine's side. With her walking around a hallway in her home and being peered at through a small gap in a door, we see just through the gap with black all around. A point of view shot in this instance, it also serves to obscure who is there with her and further confuse and mislead the audience. Though we know who we can rule out, it hardly limits the options and has the ability to keep the audience continuously on edge. This may be a bit of fan service and self-indulgent as he emulates some of his best works in this moment, but it is not ineffective. Just because it is a trademark does not make it wrong and I love the split-screens in his films with this scene being an example of why. Tense, thrilling, and keeping the audience completely on edge, this is a great example of why it is a terrific tool."", ""De Palma is also known for his oblique angles at times and Passion features a lot of them. Many times, they can be a bit more subtle, but here they take center stage. As things begin to spiral out of control at the office. Showing the balance of power in certain scenes, one of my favorites is an oblique angle shot of Christine's offices. With shadows pouring into the room, Christine's back is to us as Isabelle's walks into the office. Not expecting the cold response from Christine, scene is chilly and uncomfortable, in large part because of the shot. Every scene with an oblique angle shot, such as the sexual harassment scene between Christine and Dani (Karoline Herfurth), are unsettling. While occasionally thrilling in these moments, they are mostly just hard to watch and a brilliant piece of filmmaking. Of course, these scenes are also bolstered by the use of shadows. Often used to trap in characters, many characters are trapped here, both literally and figuratively. Christine is trapped by Isabelle. Isabelle is trapped by Dani. The inspector is trapped by lies. Dirk Harriman (Paul Anderson) is trapped by Christine and Isabelle. Shadows and bars adorn them all and lock them up in their visual prison before some of them wind up in actual prison. Along with the split-screens and oblique angles, the shadows bless Passion with an incredible visual style."", ""An erotic thriller, Passion may not be one of De Palma's best works, but its aesthetic is undeniable. Though its substance pales in comparison to those in his best works, the plot is still quite compelling and twisty, even if it makes very little sense and has major plotholes. The plot also suffers from an overreliance on dream sequences and fake outs that hurt the suspense and thrills, rather than fostering either. Yet, the camera work here is tremendous and the more I watch De Palma's films, the more I have come to appreciate that his style and camera movements are the main draw of his films, not necessarily just the plot. Passion is the epitome of this, hence its negative reception. Thus, for those who enjoy De Palma and his trademarks as a director, Passion should exceed expectations."" ]";5

Truly plotless, Franches Ha could certainly be seen as being a touch pretentious by some, but I enjoyed it very much. It never drags and always engages you and makes you feel invested in the life of this girl who is in a bit of a rough patch of her life.

Somehow, it managed to be this good of a science fiction film with beautiful production design and effects with an under $10 million production budget, which is worthy of acclaim.

Its plot is cliche. Once you figure out what the trick up the film's sleeve is, the magic does disappear some. Plotholes, likely, abound. Yet, the sleight of hand and wool over our eyes is thoroughly enjoyable. It is fun to be tricked in this way because of the show that goes on. The reveal, the mystery, and the entire show put on by the film is more than enough to make me not overly concerned about the film's faults under the hood. The thing runs on pure adrenaline, even if the engine is bone dry and the brakes are shot."", ""With a great cast turning in charismatic performances, this fervent energy put forth by Now You See Me is greatly impacted by this cast. Having a great time, this large cast of talented actors have minor characters to chew on, but they play them incredibly well and breathe life into this film. While director Louis Letterier is largely struggling to keep up with the magic of the tale, the actors are always game and hamming it up in their roles. In particular, Woody Harrelson is perfectly cast and his performance underscores why he is perfect for this wise cracking mentalist. Alongside him, Jesse Eisenberg is great as a self-assured jerk, which is another great piece of casting. That said, how dare he call Isla Fisher fat. Has he seen her? If she's fat, then every woman is fat. That said, the fun lines and actors do blind us to how horrible these characters truly are. They are not paper thin, they are non-existent. The casting is so good because the actors just act according to their typecast. There is no nuance and no character development."", ""The plot, likewise, is all a ruse. The compelling premise is great and Letterier has a lot of fun with it throughout the film. Constant twists and surprises along the way keep the film feeling fresh and engaging. It is a film with a great imagination and lots of tricks in its bag. However, it does all cover up a thin plot. The end result is hard to wrap your brain around, half because the distractions and magic were so good and half because the plot makes no sense. The former outweighs the latter, however, because of the aforementioned energy and adrenaline of the film. Without this energy, the problems would be far more detrimental than they are, but it is hard to deny that the film is incredibly entertaining with the mystery and confusion of the plot being nothing more than part of its appeal. A good magic trick leaves you guessing and shocked with no clue as how it was pulled off. The film itself is just like this with the film being more about the experience and tricks it pulls, instead of whatever is up its sleeves."", ""The film does suffer from the bad romance between Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent. They have some chemistry, but it is very cheesy and adds nothing to the film whatsoever. It is not cute and it does not add depth. It merely distracts from the good part of the film - the magic - and makes me realize just how truly awful this film is and deserves to be derided far more than it was. Fortunately, this is only a small part of the film so I can write it off and move it out of my mind while focusing on the more positive aspects of this film."", ""A bad, thinly plotted, thinly written, and distracting film, the greatest trick Now You See Me pulls it making me thoroughly enjoy it. For all of its faults, the film is the kind of summer film with serious pizzazz that rides on the charisma of its actors and the magic it creates. Now You See Me may not be good, but it is incredibly fun with infectious energy that makes you willing to look past its litany of faults."" ]";5
1126;trance;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Where is the line between a messy and convoluted film and one that is brilliantly mind bending? Danny Boyle's Trance largely walks this line and, at times, proves to be properly phenomenal. At others, the film unravels and shows just how thin it was stretched by Boyle. Though stylish, compelling, and a truly trippy experience, Trance has some moments that simply do not add up and, even then, its plot is nothing more than Inception by way of Boyle's fast paced point of view. While proving to be a riveting experience at times with how Boyle constantly pulls the rug out from under you, it is merely a slice of entertainment that serves to divert you attention away from the sad twist awaiting you at the end. That said, it is a brilliantly shot film with a terrific visual style. Unfortunately, it simply does not add up to being an equally great film."", ""With a penchant for lens flares during dream/trance sequences, Danny Boyle's Trance is a gorgeous film. The lighting, translucent walls, and vibrant colors adorn this film at every turn and really make it a visually splendid endeavor. Boyle introduces a few oblique angles in this one of an apartment building, hinting at how things may go wrong in this place of residence. A beautifully taken shot, the glowing of the street lights on wet cobblestone and rock exterior of the building is a tremendous film. Even if it is a dangerous place, it is a place that beckons the viewer just as it beckons Simon (James McAvoy). Manipulated, confused, and lost from the very beginning, Simon is a man who is unaware of his past, his present, and what is truly real as a result of the hypnosis, hits on the head, and actions of his past. McAvoy is good in the role, even if it does not come close to the brilliance of his turn in Split. Alongside him, Vincent Cassel is slippery as an eel and Naomie Harris goes fully nude (even down below) in a good role that, again, does not reach the level of his 2016 performance in Moonlight. Thus, the film is not just a mishmash of colors, but also a great opportunity for these actors and one they take full advantage of throughout."", ""Boyle infuses the film with his usual style. His fast paced film editing technique comes in handy here with quick cuts and a lot of panache behind the camera. Yet, the very peak of this film is the opening. The heist sequence during the art auction is brilliant. It is plotted out well, incredibly well captured, and drop dead tense. This is a film that comes out firing on all cylinders with a compelling first act that sets the entire plot into motion. Boyle also has considerable fun with the plot itself, allowing it to spiral out of control at times and become borderline messy and too convoluted. He embraces this and paints the film as a beautiful disaster at times to varying effect. That said, even when the film becomes too much and makes no sense, it is fun to watch Boyle fling everything at the wall without a care for what sticks and what does not stick. As a talented director, he is in full control of this insanity and, likely, a lot of it does not make sense to him either, but to try and understand this one would lead to simply not understanding the purpose of the film. It is a film that puts you in a trance and leads you down various allies. It is not to be understood, but rather, it is an exercise in visual style and fully dynamic."", ""SPOILERS"", ""Unfortunately, the film does not always quite add up plot-wise. The biggest issue in Trance is the ending. The twist reveals that it was Elizabeth (Naomie Harris) who had put Simon in a trance and led to him assisting in the art theft. She manipulated him and made him forget his past relationship with her in order to end his obsession and get rich off of the deal regardless. Yet, in the beginning, we see she does not know Simon. She plays it off that she does not in front of him, yes, but Boyle includes a scene where she looks up Simon on the internet and investigates recent news stories about him, including one about the heist. She acts like she does not know who he is, because if she knew who he was, she would have known about the heist and who Simon was without the help of Google. This is not something that is rectified and is something that seems odd. The film is subversive and tries to distract the viewer from fully understanding, but it becomes clear that the twist is added for shock value, rather than it actually making any sense with the rest of the film. There are hints - restaurant, the book, etc. - that do add up to the ending, but that internet search sequence is glaring and problematic."", ""END SPOILERS"", ""Hypnotic, confusing, and a visual feast for the eyes, Danny Boyle's Trance does not always work, but it is a riveting film that provides solid entertainment throughout. It is a film that seems to be making things up as it goes, but for his part, Danny Boyle infuses incredible style and has a lot of fun with the mind bending psychological thriller."" ]";5
1127;pacific-rim;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""I really like Guillermo del Toro and this one is no exception. While a lesser work of his, Pacific Rim is a decidedly fun, action-packed, and well thought out monster/alien invasion kind of film. With fantastic special effects and impeccable creature design, as well as robot design, Pacific Rim is an impressively crafted film. At every turn, the effects never ceased to impress me and really was a treat to watch. The film had to have been truly impressive in 3D. That said, the film does have problems. It can be a little over-the-top and the script is sketchy at best. Some of it is well-written, but far too many of them was just not well done. Charlie Day's character can be quite annoying, largely because Day has no sense of nuance and has an annoying voice in his own right, but here, it is not reigned in. Plus, it feels totally out of place in a film that is otherwise quite serious. If it were a comedy, Charlie Day would have been appropriate pick, but not here. The acting is fine, though can be a little hammy at times and I would certainly stop short of calling it good. Fortunately, the film is fun, has an important message of togetherness to communicate, and has truly incredible special effects. Far from perfect, Pacific Rim is still a fun summer romp."" ]";5
1128;promised-land;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Promised Land is a celebration of this forgotten group of people. The farmers that slave daily to see their crops be profitable. The people that were left over when a factory closed. With a natural gas salesman swooping in and telling them to sell off their land to be fracked and strike it rich from the efforts of the gas company, Promised Land shows how much more is at stake. Fighting back against the fracking due to what it would do to their family's land, the people of this small Pennsylvania town are not so willing to sell out their land and their animals. After the government and their old jobs took everything else, this land and farm is all they have left and they are not willing to see it be sold to possibly become ruins after it is fracked. Showing the big conglomerate Global Crosspower Solutions do all they can to try and win over this town, Promised Land shows that those in the positions of  the farmers are not just doing what they are out of pure arrogance or pride. This is all they have and they will not stand by and let it be destroyed in some get rich quick scheme. Something's are more important than money and this is one of them."", ""Sending in Steve Butler (Matt Damon) and Sue Thomason (Frances McDormand) to close the deal in the town, the two make very good headway and begin to have great success. However, a town meeting goes awry with science teacher, MA in Engineering holder, and former employee of Boeing Frank Yates (Hal Holbrook) arguing that fracking is not good for the water supply. Rattled, Steve winds up agreeing to a vote over whether or not the natural gas company can enter the town or not. Shortly after, environmentalist Dustin Noble (John Krasinski) arrives in town and begins rallying the troops against Steve and Global, even stealing Steve's new girl Alice (Rosemarie Dewitt)."", ""Celebrating this working class American who loves the land and simply wants to be able to make ends meet, the two sides begin to clash. The two can see the benefit in selling out and making money while they can through a new industry. However, if it ruins the land, they will not be able to live with themselves. Elegantly showing the struggle faced by these citizens and how they know they need to find something new to do, but are too committed to their family farm to want to try and find a new option, Promised Land shows the tragic decision put before them: lose their identity or lose their dignity. It is not an easy choice and the film shows the negative forces surrounding their decision: propaganda from the environmentalists and empty promises and strong-arm tactics from the energy industry. Between the two, it feels like no decision is the right one and whatever route is chosen, one must follow their heart and figure out what is right through thorough soul searching."", ""However, in spite of its nuanced approach to these two sides, Promised Land can get a  bit preachy at the end with its anti-corporate message and its pro-environment closing monologue by Damon's character. While it is well-written, it devolves into a bit of a public service announcement and is far too preachy in its third act to really make it all come together. Fortunately, until then, it gives a voice to the muted. Those whose issues are not worth becoming passionate over for many Americans and whose voices are written off as belonging to some nefarious group stuck in the past. These are hard working people who do what they do out of respect for their past generations and because they love what they do. Through people such as Alice, Frank, and Jeff Dennon (Scoot McNairy), we see just how they work to be able to accomplish anything. Shortcuts are not an option as they have spilled too much sweat on the soil to just sell it off. It is a part of who they are and they are a part of it. If it dies due to fracking, then a whole lot more than a few acres of land are dead: their whole lives are dead and gone forever."", ""Featuring an excellent lead performance from Damon alongside strong supporting turns from McDormand, Holbrook, Krasinski, Dewitt, McNairy, Titus Welliver, and Lucas Black, Promised Land may not be as good as the previous Gus Van Sant directed and Matt Damon co-written effort, but it is a good film nonetheless. Shining the spotlight on an area covered in eternal darkness with strong characters that bring the film to life with realistic drama and natural and easy flowing comedy, Promised Land is a film that has unfortunately been met with a mixed reception. In spite of its reception, it is an essential film that openly debates the pros and cons of fracking, as well as how things can get misrepresented in these cases and how much influence big companies truly have in the world. Bringing to the forefront the lives of farmers is not glamorous, but it is incredibly well taken in this smart, funny, and sad, story of a town fighting for its life against a natural gas giant."" ]";5

This one really manages to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film with each twist and turn you do not see coming. The writing here is splendid and the way the story is presented by Soderbergh is a major strength for this one. The cinematography is also strong here, as is usually the case in Soderbergh's films. The film does take many twists, some of them easier to figure out than others, but ultimately,it manages to keep things really interesting as this one could easily be categorized as many things; medical thriller, psychological thriller, crime drama, and a little bit of courtroom drama, all of which keep things lively and interesting.

Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts, and Tom Holland, are all incredible and emotionally powerful in this film about a true story set in the 2004 tsunami in Thailand. While it was criticized for being whitewashed, the film's story is simply too powerful to be constricted by race and instead it is a truly human story. Additionally, the cinematography and special effects are truly breathtaking. From beginning to end, I was struck by the beauty of this film and it really contributed to the overall inspiration and feel of the film. The direction from JA Bayona was very good and it reinforced my belief that he is a guy to watch and keep an eye on. Overall, The Impossible is a truly harrowing film that both breaks and warms your heart with ease thanks to its powerful premise and effective approach to its true material."" ]";5

Brad Pitt is great in the lead role and entirely convincing as humanity's last hope. The film also does a great job eliciting emotion from the audience, as there are a few scenes that really keep you on the edge of your seat and that take you by surprise. This is in large part thanks to the some great direction from Marc Forster and some very good cinematography. The special effects with the zombies are also incredible, as is the makeup. The film definitely feels as though it is setting up for a sequel and I would definitely love to see one be made, especially considering how this one does not quite feel finished due to that. Overall, World War Z is an expertly made action-thriller that manages to entertain throughout."" ]";5

Beautifully shot with fantastic cinematography, Gangster Squad is an impeccably stylish and well put together gangster flick. With good turns from its impressive cast, Gangster Squad matches its good actors with a compelling plot that keeps you hooked with its real life basis. The characters are hit-and-miss (Emma Stone's character in particular is a miss), but otherwise, I thought they were well crafted or at least satisfyingly so compared to other movies out there nowadays. The action is well shot and the violence is nowhere near as bad as some critics would have you think. While not as good as classic noirs or modern day takes on the genre, Gangster Squad is a flashy, lavishly shot gangster film that satisfies the eyes more than the mind, but that is okay in my book given its good pacing, compelling story, and again, its over-abundance of style."" ]";5

Firstly, from a horror aspect, there are some truly terrifying scenes that really get the juices flowing. There are not many, but there are some and damn are they effective. The film also sports some great acting from Rebecca Hall and Dominic West who really dominate the screen every time they are shown. The mise en scene is gorgeous, especially the production design. Really beautifully put together all-around. The mystery/thriller portion of this one is interesting and really opens the door for interesting discussions on loneliness, death, and the afterlife. However, the film simply tries to do too much, which is ultimately its undoing. Though ravishingly beautiful and well-written, it overreaches and would have been best served narrowing its focus and really digging deeper into one particular issue. Ultimately, the first three quarters of this one are quite strong, but then comes the lackluster final quarter, which really could have been done better."" ]";5

Featuring numerous different time periods and the same actors playing different characters (but not really), Cloud Atlas is wonderfully directed and though it takes a bit of adjusting to, if you are willing to go with the film, it is quite enjoyable. An interesting film that touches on thoughts of reincarnation, our purpose in life, karma, and the importance of our actions, Cloud Atlas is wildly ambitious. Most certainly a film I will need to watch again, the cast in its entirety is fantastic. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, Susan Sarandon, and Hugh Grant, in particular are all fantastic. Every actor plays a variety of roles, which makes the film that much more compelling and also gives them all some extra chances to show off their great skill.

The characters are great, the comedy is dark, but hilarious, and the dog is fantastic. Like, my love for shih tzus is confirmed, this dog was absolutely adorable. It really stole the show for me and that is saying something given the great performances from an unhinged Sam Rockwell, Colin Farrell, Christopher Walken, and Woody Harrelson. This one was not what I expected in the least and the way it was very much about the writing of this film (a la Charlie Kaufman's \""Adaptation\"") was pretty odd and unique. The self-referential stuff does get a bit tiresome towards the end, but the film remains a blast to watch thanks to its writing and acting. Overall, much of this one is clicking, but as I said, the self-referential stuff gets tiring and it kind of takes you out of this one by the end, but even then, it is a solid flick that is certainly worth a watch.

I love films like this that have these huge casts and I keep seeing all these character actors who I recognize from other films or television shows. Daniel Day-Lewis was great (though I prefer him in Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood, personally). Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, and David Costabile, are also major bright spots. As a whole, this is an at times very interesting film about Lincoln himself, as well as everything he went through trying to get the 13th amendment passed. The performances, direction, and costume design, are all major pluses to this historical film. However, it felt a little long. Some of it could have been trimmed and the final product would have benefited from it. On top of that, Mary Todd Lincoln was almost exclusively portrayed as a total b****, while Robert Lincoln was almost exclusively shown as a wannabe soldier. Thus, I almost think Jospeh Gordon-Levitt's portion could be trimmed significantly, though his performance was fine. I also wish they either showed more elements of Mary Lincoln or trimmed her down and focused exclusively on Lincoln, his Cabinet, and the House. The ending is also poor, as it does not even show anything. While I am not a huge fan of gore, at least hearing a gunshot would have been an added plus. The way they did it felt as if they were purposely keeping us at a distance, which is annoying. The film can also be a little tedious at times and fails to hold your interest throughout the entire run time (largely thanks to the parts that add nothing much to the film as a whole). However, as a whole, the film is very well made and very well done from all parties and stands as a great look at history and is poignant even today, as though the issues are different, the divide between parties and the way votes work is all too similar."" ]";5

He is brilliant. The supporting cast is also great. The direction from David Cronenberg is great as usual and so is the cinematography. Honestly, it is impressive for a film to be so cold and uninviting, yet so brilliant at the same time. This film is incredibly divisive, which is understandable.

Featuring fantastic stage design, costume design, and makeup, Les Miserables oozes beauty and 1800s France. Additionally, the cinematography is fantastic and truly soaks up this beauty to the max.

At the end of the day, this one has themes like every other film, but for the most part, the question, \""What is this one about?\"" can be answered by saying that it is a character study of a deeply troubled man and his father-son type relationship with a cult leader. Nothing profound or deep and, to me, many people are looking into this one too closely and looking for something that is simply not there. Now, onto the film itself. Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman are fantastic and are a great juxtaposition to one another, as Phoenix is over the top, unhinged, violent, and angry, while Hoffman is calm, cool, collected, and calculating. Amy Adams is also good here, though I do wish her role was larger, but at the end of the day, this one is about Phoenix and Hoffman's relationship. The script here is also very strong and does a fantastic job developing the characters. The cinematography is gorgeous, in particular the repeated shots of the water and then the shots of them in desert. Really well done and beautiful to look at without question. Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is also strong as well. After watching Punch-Drunk Love and not liking it after having loved There Will Be Blood and liking Hard Eight, I was still worried that maybe Anderson's films would be more hit and miss for me. However, this one convinced me that that may not be the case, as his direction and this film were really good.

Instead, it is classic feel good cinema that is easy to digest and settles easily in the stomach, rather than making a big fuss about the whole thing. Unlike the Indian food on display in the film, this is not a film that will cause diarrhea, except for those who may struggle to digest sweets. A funny and deeply endearing flick about a bunch of British people coming to teach Indians how to live life the British way, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel may be a bit too much for some, but is largely pleasant cinema. It is funny with a great cast that hardly ever puts a foot wrong acting-wise. Though a bit quaint, the film's endearing charm is really hard to overcome."", ""The film, to some, could be described as racist. Yet, it often feels like a film that is conflicted in this arena. On one hand, you have Evelyn (Judi Dench) teach professional call center workers how to talk on the phone to British people, as if they have no idea. Evelyn has no experience calling, yet talks down to them as an authority. Sonny (Dev Patel) is a charming kid who is just a scattered foreigner who has no idea what to do with running a hotel because he is a dumb foreigner (right?). Toss in repeated jokes about how bad India smells (it probably does for those who are new though, not being racist, but Indian food is a rather strong smelling food so until you adjust to being in areas where the food may be, it definitely will hit your nose hard) and jokes about Indian marriage customs and it is not hard to see why some would take offense. It is rather low-brow with this humor and these depictions, even if Muriel (Maggie Smith) oddly changes all of this for the better to a degree. Initially quite racist with broad and sweeping stereotyping attacks against Indians, Muriel grows over the course of the film to respect Indians and other races for how they help her in spite of her rude behavior. Even then, she winds up being a white savior for poor Sonny and his crappy hotel. Thus, I would have to lean towards this one being quite a bit offensive and racist, even if it does not actively intend to be this way."", ""Fortunately, it is incredibly funny. Bill Nighy, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and Dev Patel, are all an absolute pleasure to watch. Nighy, obviously, steals the show as he always does, though Patel's frantic and nervous turn gives him a run for his money. As an entire cast, this charming collection of British screen actors and the one Indian actor that Hollywood will allow (quotas and all) really make this film zip by with light enjoyment. The smart comedic script plays perfectly into the wheelhouse of its actors, allowing them to all deliver their lines with zip and comedic timing to make the lines really pop. The film may be a bit too quaint and giddy in depicting old age, but it is hard to deny that the film is funny. The comedy does not always work, but it is a film that can keep you laughing throughout and that is rather hard to come by nowadays."", ""Set in gorgeously designed locales, one of the major appeals of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is certainly its visuals. Throughout much of the film, the film is shot rather plainly, hardly ever capturing the eye. However, whenever director John Madden's camera slips out of his firm grip and captures some terrain or India at sunset by the water, it is hard not be gripped by the beauty. While the film does not really explore the terrain too much, the pieces of the set it showcases - especially the hotel - are very nicely designed and fun places to explore. Toss in some nice depictions of the hustle and bustle of India, as well as the natural beauty of the country, and you have a film that is rather pleasant to look at, even if it is rather unadventurously shot."", ""Funny, engaging, and largely quite pleasant, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is simply easy breezy entertainment. It is easy to find fault in its picture perfect facade, but why nitpick a film that I found so pleasant and fun to watch? Honestly, however, watching Bill Nighy do anything in a film is going to garner at least a lukewarm positive response from me and this film is hardly an exception to that rule. Though not the most artistic film ever made, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is the type of cheesy and idealistic Hollywood film that just feels good to watch. It is like the ratty pair of sweatpants your mom begs you not to wear in public, but I want to wear them BECAUSE THEY ARE COMFORTABLE DAMMIT."" ]";5
1149;margaret;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""At three hours, the extended cut of this film is a really behemoth. I am watching director Kenneth Lonergan's filmography is reverse order, having already seen Manchester by the Sea before watching Margaret. That said, this film further shows that there is a rule when watching a Longeran. If things can get worse, they absolutely will. In this film, a woman is killed by a bus and young Lisa Cohen (Anna Paquin) is a witness and a cause of the accident, as she purposely distracted the bus driver. The rest of the film depicts her trying to right this wrong and come to terms with the negative impact she had in this case. Largely a character study, Margaret is a film with a dire and pessimistic depiction of the world and of human beings. Yet, as is the case with his follow-up to this film, Margaret is oddly emotionally cathartic. Though it really goes the full 12 rounds with your heart and emotions, the film is an operatic and beautiful portrayal of life, death, teenagers, and human relationships."", ""The star of this film is Lisa Cohen. A teenage high school student, Lisa is a complicated character. Young, naive, angsty, antagonistic, strident, dramatic, and in a rush to grow up even if she knows nothing, Lisa is not somebody many people should like. However, why this film soars as a character study is Lonergan's refusal to judge her. At the end of the day, all of this anger, mistreatment of her mother, and distance, comes from her regret and pain over causing the death of a woman. She finds ways to deal with the pain and try to forget about it, though it is causing her great strain in her life and her relationships. She needs to release it all and let herself off the hook. By the end of the film, no matter how bratty and irresponsible and disrespectful she acts, you cannot help but feel great sympathy for her and what she has been through. It is tough growing up, let alone seeing such a gruesome death at a young age. Even more challenging, she is idealistic and believes the world must operate in a certain fashion. Though adults grow out of this, as said in the film, teenagers still have this clear view of the world. When things do not align in this fashion and people do not trip over themselves to agree with her, she is confused, affronted, and distraught. Though her traits make her sound horrible, Margaret truly portrays a tragic picture of Lisa and the shattering of her innocent and naive world. Ignorance is truly bliss and for her, she will no longer be ignorant."", ""An incredibly powerful film, it is clear that Lonergan loves the opera as much as Damien Chazelle loves jazz. With characters going to the opera multiple times in the film, the clearest definition of Lonergan's love of opera is the end. Cathartic, the opera leaves young Lisa in tears next to her mother, Joan (J. Smith-Cameron). The close shows Lisa embrace Joan in tears. While showing the power of the opera, it also shows tremendous growth for Lisa. Fighting with her mother throughout the film, she is now willing to accept her with open arms. She has grown up and is moving past her angsty and existential teenager phase."", ""At times, however, the film also parallels Lisa's interpretation of the opera. Perceiving it to be merely a medium in which the singers try to yell as loud as possible, Lisa's life is very much the same. Fighting with her mom, fighting with strangers, fighting with classmates, and more, she is antagonistic and looking for somebody to unleash upon at all turns. It is as if she is in her own opera and trying to outscream those around her, out of a belief that she knows best in spite of her lack of life experience. This behavior reveals a lot about her character throughout as her response to conflict is to become defensive and argumentative. She shuts out others and just assumes she is correct without altering her view. Yet, it makes sense because her mother is the same way. She overreacts and takes disagreement as a personal attack. She overreacts and pushes people away just because of a disagreement."", ""Powerful, depressing, and very long, Margaret's extended cut suffers from some filler. Moments come and go without adding much to the plot. That said, as the film is attempting to replicate real life, these moments are pretty easy to make sense of in the world of the film. Though everything may not advance the plot, the plot is merely an excuse to study Lisa and what makes her tick. This examination works as a large examination of teenagers and their place in the world. For Lonergan, the world is dark and depressing. Teenagers may wish they were older and try to put themselves in adult situations (losing their virginity and having sex), but the realities of adulthood (abortion, death, pain, loneliness, and injustice) will show them that being an adult is not easy. By the end, Lisa has realized this and shows her mother long overdue affection. Sadly, it comes as a result of her losing her innocence and optimism."" ]";5

From great dialogue to great characterization to a great story, Brave’s script is all that I can ask for from a film. Additionally, the film is well paced and even when it establishes its story, Brave never slows down and keeps you entertained throughout. Finally, the music is phenomenal, especially the song \""Learn Me Right\"". Fantastic stuff.

I was incredibly impressed with his performance. I really enjoyed Shirley MacLaine's performance, but I have a soft spot for Matthew McConaughey. He really portrayed the hard nosed Texan District Attorney really well. At the end of the day, this one really reminded me of Gone Baby Gone but funny. The conflict is different, but it leaves you feeling the same way. Another touch that I enjoyed from this one was the documentary-esque way of telling the story. With all the interviews from locals about everybody, it was a nice addition that really re-enforced that this one was a real story."", """", ""I do not really have any complaints that I can think of, but something was missing.

A Hallstrom film without a happy ending is not a Hallstrom film and this is often to his film's detriment. He is so risk averse, he churns out merely palatable films like nobody else can. Yet, he is also consistent with many of these palatable films being oddly sweet and satisfying. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen fits the bill here. Telling the story of a Yemeni Shekih who wants to bring salmon fishing to Yemen and the efforts of the British to help make his dream a reality, the film is sweet, charming, and funny. Highlighting the absurdity of the task at hand and using it as an exploration of faith and unity, Hallstrom's film is a largely non-descript and is easy and breezy to watch."", ""With two strong performances anchoring the film, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen was always off to a good start. Though safe, it is elevated by typically top-notch performances from Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt. The duo have good chemistry. As Dr. Alfred Jones, the fisheries expert tasked with making the project a reality, McGregor is great. Middle aged and unhappy in his loveless marriage, he clearly still wants his wife. However, her boring and lack of affection leave him feeling isolated and alone, even in his marriage. For Blunt, she portrays Harriet, who works for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Initially alone before meeting a soldier, falling in love, only for him to go MIA and be declared dead in war, Harriet quickly goes from alone to broken. In the meantime, she meets Alfred and the two obviously strike a romance. Yet, Hallstrom crafts one without serious pay-off. As in his all his films, there is a happy ending. But, there is no big kiss here. Instead, we get small touches, small glances, and subtly flirtatious dialogue between the two. So, while the film is a romance, it bound by reality all the same. It is not some bombastic or fantastical experience. Rather, it is drawn out and is slowed down by real life issues and real life trauma."", ""Additionally, though the plot of bringing salmon to Yemen may seem absurd, the film realizes this. Thus, Hallstrom largely turns it into an exercise that symbolizes faith and unity. Aiming to create unity for his people by bringing an activity that he loves to them, in order for them to flock to the river to fish and bond through it, the sheikh strives to better his people and this is just the first step. To accompany the river, he wishes to turn the valley into an agricultural center for things to be grown in and harvested. The sheikh aims to create a bond and show that a village that works together is stronger than one that does not. In trying times for the region, he wants to build a bridge, not walls. This is certainly understandable. The sheikh also has a religious twist to it, comparing fishing to religion due to the immense faith it requires. Thus, undoubtedly, he sees fishing as giving glory to God and offering thanks for the bounty they receive via fishing and harvest. The sheikh, while rich, seeks to give glory to God by honoring the things He has given humanity: fertile soil, fish, and the knowledge of how to use both. In this way, the film is definitely inspiring to a degree and shows how power can be used for good in the face of strife and animosity in the region the sheikh lives."", ""Largely quite funny, charming, and thoroughly enjoyable, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is safe to watch with your mother. That said, it is decidedly light watching. Largely predictable and the kind of film to toss on when distracted, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen still remains a pretty good film thanks to good acting and some decent morals and messages delivered along the way."" ]";5
1153;carnage-2011;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Adapted from a play, Carnage is set in a single room and is a dramatic and uproariously comical black comedy-drama from director Roman Polanski. Bringing together two couples who have to discuss an incident between their respective sons, the civilized encounter quickly turns nasty and shows the carnage of the situation between their sons. Opening wounds regarding their marriages, lives, and characters, the encounter soon descends into chaos with in-fighting and larger revelations about the world around us with the carnage extending far beyond expectations. Set in just the living room of one of the couple's homes with some scenes in the bathroom and hallway, the film is easily identified as a play, but is one hell of a play translated to film. One of the greatest accomplishments of the film, however, is how it characterizes each person. While the acting is exemplary, the characters are feasts for the eyes and have a lot of meat on their bones. This is largely examined when each is put on the hot seat and attacked by the other three people in the room, with the person on the hot seat constantly changing. What is crucial, however, is how fake each person is, which becomes apparent quite quickly."", ""The person who wants the meeting the most is undeniably Penelope Longstreet (Jodie Foster). Married to Michael (John C. Reilly), her self-righteous, savior of the world persona becomes readily apparent in her interactions with Alan Cowan (Christoph Waltz). Constantly dramatizing his words and editorializing them, the attack on her child by the Cowan's boy is clearly seen as a personal affront because she sees the world in a particular way. As she describes, she is a believer in a civilized world with a set rule of law where violence has no place. Everybody else, however, has there point of difference on this stance and Penelope's superiority complex is constantly derided. Foster does a great job capturing both the defensiveness and perplexed nature of the character. Clearly an educated white liberal (I am independent, so this is not an attack on politics), Penelope seems to have operated in an echo chamber all her life with a husband who just gives up rather than fight her. As such, she is shocked to see anybody dare to trivialize the turmoil in Africa - which she has never seen first hand - in favor of issues that impact their immediate lives instead. She is prim, proper, and to the point, unafraid to express her opinion. The way in which the character is written feels incredibly authentic. The script by Yasmina Reza and Polanski really highlight what is important to this character when Nancy Cowan (Kate Winslet) pukes on her coffee table. Though she later apologized, Penelope freaks out that Nancy puked on her one-of-a-kind art magazine or something. Valuing culture above all else - family included - Penelope pretends to be conscientious of the world around her, but is just as materialistic and vapid as the rest of us."", ""As for her husband Michael, he is a shockingly cruel man. Killing his daughter's pet hamster Nibbles because he does not like rodents, Michael casually criticizes those who have kids and describes newlyweds as \""poor **** who will wake up to the truth soon enough. Clearly unhappy in his marriage, nihilistic, and cynical about the world around him, Michael is a man whose values may be less clear than the others. Buying tulips to keep up appearances in front of the Cowans even though he does not want to meet with them, he is a guy who values money and displays of wealth. The tulips are a small part of this, but his emphasis on illegal acquired and expensive cigars, the 18-year old malt liquor, and his belief that kids are a drain on the lives of the parents, it is clear he values material wealth. While his wife is more concerned with what the money buys and the culture she lives in, Michael just likes to buy items that show off how much money he has acquired in his life."", ""On the other side of the table are the Cowans. Alan, a successful lawyer in the midst of a legal issue with a pharmaceutical company's unsuccessful drug, is clearly distracted. Constantly on the phone, he is like Michael in that he does not want to be there. He does not value his children and could care less about his son. As the ending shows, his son apologized on his own to the child he hurt. Yet, he casually casts him aside a maniac incapable of emotion and sympathy. He, according to his wife Nancy, delegates all matters of the kids and the home to his wife as that is his role. In this way, he is incredibly paternalistic. The man works and the woman raises the kids. He cannot process other methods of doing things, hence his need to constantly work in order to feel busy and accomplished. Since he barely has the wife and the kids are long gone from him, Alan focuses in on the only element he is good at: providing. As such, he is constantly on the phone and is obsessed with the thing.

Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, and Brie Larson, are fantastic and Hill and Tatum have a great chemistry with one another. The film flows really well and is a great modern teen comedy blended with classic tropes of the genre. Additionally, I loved the unexpected cameo towards the end of the film from another undercover duo. It was super unexpected and hilarious. Honestly, the whole movie is quite well-written and well-directed, which I was not expecting at all.

1155;shame;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A haunting, horrifying, and harrowing portrayal of self-hatred, Shame is a dreadfully melancholy and truly abrasive look at the spiral one can go through when suffering. With an incredible lead performance from Michael Fassbender anchoring Steve McQueen's exploration of sex addiction, self loathing, and depression, Shame is a film unlike many others. It takes real courage to explore sex addiction in a meaningful way, as many write it off as something that is impossible to be addicted to and, as such, not a real addiction. Instead, sex addicts are cast aside as dirty perverts who are the shame of society. As Brandon Sullivan (Fassbender) shows, however, he does not enjoy sex. It is a need. It provides a momentary high and then he comes crashing back down to earth into a rapidly spiraling out of control mire of self hatred."", ""From the very beginning of the film, McQueen adorns his film with shades of blue and gray. Melancholy and depressing colors, Brandon wears a gray jacket with a blue scarf daily. The scenes behind him at home, work, and on the subway, are covered with grays and blues. This colorization truly sets the scene for the film, which is incredibly depressing and a dark look at depression as a whole, both through Brandon and his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan). In many ways, Sissy is just like Brandon. When he finds her unexpectedly in his apartment, she is in the shower and has no problems with Brandon seeing her naked. The two of them are incredibly open with one another to the point that she has sex in Brandon's bed with him in the other room and makes out with a guy in a cab right next to Brandon. The two know the other is a sexual being, but they have a similarity: they use sex to disguise the pain. Sissy is suicidal with numerous scars on her arms and flirts with jumping in front of a pain. Brandon himself sort of just mopes around the film, rejecting human companionship of any kind in favor of short lasting jolts of sexual energy with random people. For Brandon, he is straight, but will pay for sex, pick up women, watch porn, read porn, or accept sex from men. Anything to get his fix fits the bill and it is how he covers up the pain. Sissy, in the short time we see her, seemingly does the same thing with references to past lovers and an obsession with her current lover. Thus, she is far less fleeting and more concerned with finding long-term connections with somebody who can mend her broken pieces. Unfortunately, she cannot find this person, as she is unable to fix herself first."", ""In its exhaustive sex scenes, Shame may turn off more than a few viewers. However, if you watch the film and go with it, it becomes clear that this is not an erotic film. The sex scenes are depressive. They are cathartic for Brandon as he gets his fix, but it continues to fuel his spiral of self loathing. It is clear he is disgusted with himself. He feels intense shame to the point that he throws out of all his porn magazines, computer, and anything else that is of a sexual nature. He tries to move on and become normal. He goes on a date with a woman from work and tries to be nice without taking her home on the first date. However, once he has sex with her, it does not do it for him. He must get his fix, so he calls up a random girl and has sex with her instead. He follows up it with a threesome towards the end of the film and a random encounter with a guy. Though he does these things, it is not voluntary. Brandon is addicted to sex, yes, but he keeps indulging in this addiction because he cannot stand himself. Looking in the mirror is a tiring task and, when he does, he does not like what he sees. Undeniably, Brandon is suicidal and suffering from intense depression. Sex does not even make him happy, he merely goes through the motions because it has become the norm. Actually meaningful sex is a foreign concept to him and one that is no longer able to perform. Cheap throwaway sex with random women is the only thing that keeps him going. Unfortunately, it only feeds his self-hatred as he becomes even more depressed that he is so alone. His addiction leaves him unable to find a companion for longer than four months or, as is often the case, a single night. It is this spiral that makes the film only slightly one about sex addiction. Rather, it is a film about how people cope. For Brandon, it is via sex (which is certainly addicted to) and it is the only way he can make himself feel. For Sissy, it is through cutting herself and throwing herself into relationships."", ""A tragic and often hard to watch film, Shame shines a lot on the depravity one can do to themselves when they do not love themselves. Brandon Sullivan is one of the most depressed characters in a film in recent years and Fassbender truly brings him to life in a shockingly brilliant performance. Alongside him, Carey Mulligan breathes life into Sissy, who is equally as depressive as her brother. Together, they make one somber and melancholy duo."" ]";5
1156;the-iron-lady;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Much like the woman it depicts, The Iron Lady is an incredibly divisive film. Its detractors decry its portrayal of Margaret Thatcher's dementia, the inaccuracies, the clear liberal messaging about women in power, and how it ignores the nitty gritty of her career as Prime Minister in favor of that focus on dementia. Those in favor champion the acting of Meryl Streep, the stirring portrayal of a woman who broke barriers to become the first female Prime Minister, and the film's script that eschews typical genre cliches in favor of an intimate look at the former Prime Minister. By the end of the film, as with her time as Prime Minister, it becomes clear that the truth is somewhat in the middle. The Iron Lady has its missteps. It has its triumphs. Yet, at the end of the day, it paints a clearer picture of the woman behind the actions she took instead of just portraying the actions she took, which is a noble and unusual approach to this type of biopic."", ""In criticizing The Iron Lady, some critics argued that the film was too down the middle. For such a divisive figure, it never seemed to pick a side. Is she a hero or is she a cruel wench? Depicting both sides in equal measure, this may honestly be the film's greatest accomplishment. In portraying her dementia with great emotional resonance and authentically showing how she copes with the death of husband Denis (Jim Broadbent), The Iron Lady immediately makes Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep) a sympathetic figure. Watching her hallucinate that Denis is there before realizing she must give him away and stop living in the past is honestly hard to watch. It rips your heart out and reminds me of my own grandmother and her crippling depression after the death of my grandfather in April 2014. Since his death, she has never been the same and has continued to wither away due to falls and Parkinson's. Margaret Thatcher's struggles to cope with the death of her husband especially hit home for that reason, as well as her struggles with dementia. Though a bit crude in including this in the final picture, it does add a lot of emotional depth to the film and shows a period of time that the public never really got to see."", ""Yet, while the film shows this sympathy, it simultaneously shows her brutality. Shutting down dissenting opinion, carrying herself with a pompous attitude, and doing nothing for the poor beside telling them to get a job, The Iron Lady does not shy away from showing Thatcher's rough edges. While her unprivileged background and struggle to become the first female Prime Minister against even her own conceptions about the British people, all paint a positive picture. However, her cold and cruel treatment of those around her and how she openly neglects her family in favor of her own ambitions, show that there is not an entirely good person underneath her hard exterior. She is not as innocent as she likes to pretend. Yet, she is not as evil as her detractors like to believe. In essence, she is an average person. There is good and there is bad. It is impossible to make a sweeping decision about her status as good or bad in a film or in life itself if they never commit some horrible atrocity. There is always two sides to the coin and The Iron Lady's smart script finds this balance."", ""Yet, the storytelling leaves a lot to be desired. Relying upon a good performance from Streep to really carry the film, The Iron Lady falters throughout. Though the portrayal of a dementia-ridden Thatcher is compelling, it never reaches the heights of its depictions of her career. These moments can often thrill and provide great dramatic tension, but arise in odd spots. The scenes are scattered throughout the film and shown as Thatcher remembering something that happened years ago. Shown in chronological order, the scenes either do not flow well with the rest of the picture or simply cut too soon. The worst offender here is when the Grand Hotel is bombed. Showing the bombing and then Margaret and Denis reuniting, we never see her speech to the public, which had been heavily praised by a female helper years later as the source of her feminine strength. Naturally, as everything in the film is balanced out, scenes of the conflict in the Falkland Islands and the decision to fight back is excellent. Showing Thatcher's backbone and strength as a leader to take steps she deems absolutely necessary, The Iron Lady paints a compelling picture of Thatcher as a strong leader. Whether or not one agrees with her politics, it is hard to deny she had great conviction in her decisions and stances."" ]";5

George Clooney is great as always, but to me, the show was stolen by Shailene Woodley.

A great blend of character study, development, and comedy, Young Adult may be a bit depressing for some, but is a great look at a deeply troubled woman trapped in adolescence due to mental illnesses. Theron brings this woman to life and makes you simultaneously hate, pity, and sympathize with her along the way as she embarrasses herself left and right along her path towards self-destruction. With Reitman's other films, namely Thank You for Smoking and Juno, I wound up being a fan from the very first shot. Young Adult was very different and actually took some warming up along the way. However, it is hard to deny such terrific dramatic and comedic writing, especially when they are blended together in a film such as this. Overall, Young Adult is a character study.

Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, and the rest of the large cast are all phenomenal.   The direction from Woody Allen is very good and the writing is strong for the most part, though it does falter at times. However, I loved the unique idea here as this one is not really a romantic film in the traditional sense. Rather, it is a love letter to Paris, the past, and the present. A unique film in which a man is able to travel back in time at midnight in Paris, this one shows a man come to terms with who he is and where he is in life by going back in time. Throughout, many scenes are filmed a gorgeous golden filter to them, which gives a feeling of \""perfection\"" and the \""golden age\"" that is allured to many times throughout the film, which provides this film with quite the luscious look to it. In addition, it manages to suck up all the beauty of the city of Paris, both in the day and night, and you can see how easy it is to fall in love with the city. Truly, this one is a very enjoyable film that makes for some easy watching, but also comes packed to the brim with ravishing imagery and some great production elements (great costumes too by the way) that really underscore the brilliance to be found here. Overall, Midnight in Paris is a very good film."" ]";5
1165;blue-valentine;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A deeply tragic film about falling out of love, Blue Valentine is only tangentially about romance. Instead, it is a larger examination of life and how we are ultimately doomed to become what we do not want to become: our parents and unhappy. A bleak and dark film, Blue Valentine is an uneasy examination of this and what appears to be director Derek Cianfrance's incredibly sad world view. Whether you agree with what the film presents or not, Blue Valentine is undeniably brilliant. With well matched leads in Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, the film consistently presents tough and depressing moments juxtaposed with truly happy and passionate moments to further your heartbreak while watching the decay of this once strong and united couple. The lighting and cinematography are brilliant, as the realistic and truly emotional writing here that helps to craft truly multi-dimensional characters that act like real human beings when confronted with tough situations. Overall, Blue Valentine is not a movie for date night. Instead, it is a good movie to watch after a tough break-up in order to get all the crying out and to say \""f*** love\""."" ]";5

Plus, this blend of western and science fiction is so unique and compelling, it is hard to look away. With solid special effects, good creature design, and scenes straight out of classic westerns, Cowboys & Aliens often feels like a classic 1970s-1980s science fiction film with the amount of fun it has for its odd premise. Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford turn in very good performances here, as does the rest of the very capable cast. Though Cowboys & Aliens is the exact opposite of a thematically challenging film, it still delivers on its tremendous premise by being a ball of energy and incredibly fun to watch. Though its general narrative is not groundbreaking, the film executes it well and brings enough originality to the table to overcome that similarity."" ]";5
1167;127-hours;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""127 Hours is a truly inspirational tale of survival with a phenomenal performance from James Franco taking centerstage. Certainly a Danny Boyle film, he creates this environment of despair, regret, and claustrophobia, that keeps you on edge and damn near hesitant to see what comes next in this truly distressing film. The film is well shot and incredibly well-written, as it is able to create interest from such a seemingly simple premise, while expertly balancing his being stuck and his past to create a well-rounded look at Aron Ralston. The film is a good length too and really is as long as it needs to be, as it is well paced and utilizes its runtime to perfection. Unfortunately, the infamous sequence in which he cuts off his arm is just too much. Traumatic to watch, the film seems to be under the belief that the audience needs to nearly pass out and watch every detail of him cutting off his arm in order to understand he is cutting off his arm. Cheap and silly, this sequence really ruins what was a very good film. As it stands, it is still pretty good, but not nearly where it could have been. Overall, if 127 Hours could hold itself back and not be so disgustingly gory and graphic, it could have been better. If you actually like watching a guy cut off his arm, boy do I have the movie for you. For others, skip over that part and stick around for this truly incredible tale of survival with a very human center."" ]";5

George Clooney turns in an understated, cool, and calculated, performance in the lead role and the cinematography from Martin Ruhe is absolutely breathtaking. The mise en scene as a whole is fantastic and the score is lush and brilliantly composed. While the pace slacks, the direction from Anton Corbijn otherwise is pretty good and he has tight control over this tense thriller. Beyond this, it often feels as though the film's plot is just Clooney walking and driving around Italy. While there is obviously more to it, the plot is just far too subtle and practically non-existent. The American is a beautiful film that really has fantastic technical aspects and is well-acted, but is just not necessarily my thing."" ]";5

He says zero lines of dialogue. Easiest check he ever cashed. Yet, he turns in a great performance in this gritty thing from director Nicolas Winding Refn. Easily my favorite film by him, it is a film packed to the brim with his trademark violence against a truly gorgeous backdrop in terms of both imagery and score. The use of color in the film (red, blue, white symbolism) goes over my head quite easily, but is compelling to look at all the same.

1170;centurion;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Centurion is a mixed bag, but there is far more good than bad. However, let's focus in on the bad. For one, it is far too violent. After a certain point, it becomes numbing and the CGI blood just becomes a major nuisance. You do not have to slit everyone's throat or show blood spurting from every wound for me to understand that war is bloody. Like, I got it. In addition, the character development is incredibly poor. Other than a few main characters, the names of these people really just slipped my mind immediately after I heard them. In war films, characters often remain largely anonymous due to a focus on action. Centurion is no different as I could not tell you who any of these people are. In saying this, however, there are many positives. For one, the film is breathtakingly gorgeous at times. The cinematography is stellar. The fight choreography is also brilliantly done, which goes hand-in-hand with the excellent action sequences. There are a good number of them, but they are all edge of your seat exciting and perfectly sequenced. The direction from Neil Marshall is not fantastic, but it gets the job done. The film feels coherent and is extremely well-paced, to the point that it feels shorter even with an already short run time. Finally, the acting from Michael Fassbender and Dominic West is great. Olga Kurylenko even does well with zero lines of dialogue. She did a great job capturing the terror instilled by her character even without uttering a single word. Overall, Centurion is a good action film that will be too violent for some, but if you can deal with that element of it, you are in for a surprise."" ]";5

Strongly written and a good blend between humor and plot, The Other Guys is actually a pretty interesting comment on the financial crises of the 2000s while being an appropriately funny police comedy. Considered a parody of buddy cop films, you can certainly see that element here as it frequently mocks those types of films, while also being a great comment on masculinity. As a whole, The Other Guys is a thoroughly hysterical film that entertains from beginning to end without stopping."" ]";5

The direction from Debra Granik is also very good and the way the story is told is solid. However, it does go a little slow at times and the bleakness is at times overwhelming and suffocates an interesting story. Plus, there are some more gruesome scenes (not really graphic, but still) that are a pet peeve of mine in films that really take me out of a film. However, as a whole, Winter's Bone is a solid look at rural life that manages to be at least somewhat interesting throughout. I am surprised this one got the praise it did, because I did not find it to be overly special, aside from the acting and the cinematography."" ]";5

Colin Firth is phenomenal in the starring role as a grieving man who is dealing with the loss of his gay lover while balancing his current life. A tale of love and loss, A Single Man is blessed with fantastic cinematography that really makes its lush style come to life and gentle writing and direction from Tom Ford to give us this worthy character study that feels as if it rings entirely true. The score is also phenomenal and really takes center stage at times in this film that often feels like moving poetry. As an overall film, A Single Man is well told and incredibly well crafted turning it into a film that makes you cry because of both its story and its sheer beauty."" ]";5

On top of that, it sports a fantastic performance from Ben Foster, as well as Woody Harrelson. Both of them really steal the show and sweep you off you feet as you entirely believe they are both heavily damaged men dealing with their own demons. On the surface, The Messenger is a film about an injured war veteran (Foster) being assigned to casualty notification duty with a hard as nails Captain (Harrelson). However, it is truly about their relationship and themselves as individuals as they learn more about one another and the other sees what troubles them. It is a very well done character study that is entirely moving in its subject matter and the way it handles this subject matter. The Messenger feels like a small film at times, but at others, it feels entirely grand and is very well done. Now, it is not a great film, but it is undeniably a damn good one and makes for a tough watch."" ]";5

Yet, I came away quite pleased. The film is as powerful and stirring as it should be given the subject matter and I thought that material was handled gracefully by the sure handed Clint Eastwood. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon were both impeccable as Mandela and Pienaar, respectively. A film that shows that genius behind Mandela's pushing of success in the 1995 Rugby World Cup for South Africa and how he used it to unite a long divided nation, this one serves as a very good history lesson for those who are unfamiliar with the story and serves as great entertainment as well. Overall, Invictus is a very good historical sports film with fantastic performances that really make the film. You can really feel the tension throughout and it all culminates beautifully at the end. The only thing that makes this one better is that it's true. All-around good film."" ]";5
1176;brothers;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Brothers is an emotionally stirring film that really packs a punch when it comes to its examination of PTSD and war. Certainly not pro-military, Brothers thankfully does not go rah rah when it comes to America, instead showcasing how everyone is not necessarily a hero, because you never know what they went through. Even if you think they are, they may vehemently disagree. It's all relative. As someone who is very skeptical when it comes to the military, I greatly appreciated this element. That said, I am not sure I am buying Tobey Maguire as a tough as nails major with his whiny voice. Fortunately, Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman are good enough to overcome that miscasting and really do fit their roles, but the writing is never quite satisfying. Though the story is well told, the film feels too short and the characters not nearly well fleshed out enough, with very little in the way of character development. Gyllenhaal's character completes a 180 without reason and very little explanation as to how, which is problematic. That said, the film's power and sharp acting performances from Gyllenhaal and Portman elevate Brothers into a more than satisfactory look at the darkside of war."" ]";5

Romantic, heartbreaking, and endlessly relatable, An Education rides on a stellar performance from Carey Mulligan who is positively magnetic in the lead role and has delicious chemistry with Peter Sarsgaard. As a romance between an older man and a teenager, the film really feels authentic with the right amount of charisma and energy brought by Sarsgaard, as well as the proper amount of mystery and intrigue surrounding him and his work. As with all of his films, Nick Hornby crafts realistic characters and creates a film that is endlessly watchable and pleasant and wholly character driven.

1178;the-book-of-eli;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""In this post-apocalyptic western, Denzel Washington stars as Eli. Traveling to the west with a book that could save the world, Eli has walked the roads that once made up America for thirty years. Near the end of his journey, he encounters a town run by a mysterious man named Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Scouring the Earth for the very book that Eli is carrying, the two face off in a battle of religious significance as the book Eli is carrying is the last Bible on Earth. After the end of the world as we knew it, religion was blamed for the collapse of society and all Bibles were burned. Only one survived, which was found by Eli after receiving a premonition from God as to where the book was located. Now determined to bring it west where God had instructed him to deliver it to whatever may be awaiting him, Eli must defend the word of God from falling into the hands of Carnegie, who wishes to use them to control and obtain absolute power over the townspeople he lives with."", ""The best way to describe the film is exactly what the title suggests: it is another book of the Bible. Depicting Eli as a man of unshakable faith who puts his head down and walks the path that God set before him, he is undoubtedly a man that makes mistakes. Though he never kills without provocation, he is a man that let a woman get attacked and not help her. He is not infallible and not some angelic figure. Instead, he is a man sent on a mission by God to deliver the Bible to people who need it and for it to be spread, once again, among the masses. As with every mission in the Bible, this one puts many tests before both Eli and God. Traversing harsh terrain in the aftermath of a flash of light that rendered the world mostly destroyed, he has walked the country for thirty years and often finds himself getting lost. Yet, what never changes is his faith in God."", ""As with any book of the Bible, the film shows that not only must Eli prove himself a man of faith who, though he may stray, carries the word of God in his heart, mind, and soul, but God will provide. Inherent in faith and any religion is that God, or whoever that religion believes in, will provide for your every need. When you are hungry, food will be there. When you are thirsty, your thirst will be quenched. When you are in danger, you will be cloaked with an invisible shield of armor and an army of men will be at your direction. Having grown up religious, this is obviously something inherent in every prayer and every waking second. God will never put you in a situation that you cannot handle and, if you wind up in something out of your control, he will help guide you out. For many, this means preventing them from death or keeping them from any harm. However, everything happens for a reason and we see Eli struggle. He gets shot, even if God previously protected him from being able to be shot, and he loses his Bible to Carnegie. Yet, no matter what happens, he is able to overcome them and continue on his path, for the word of God and his message lives not in the pages of a book, but in your heart. When I accepted God in my life, I did not pray that he would come to life in the pages of a book. I prayed that he would reside in my soul and guide my heart and mind to make sound decisions. Eli shows this and the strength he receives from the knowledge that he has the power to save the world by simply delivering himself in lieu of the book is what he eventually realizes to be the message. When he can save Solara (Mila Kunis) from her life with Carnegie, but loses the book to Carnegie, it does not mean he has lost God. God went nowhere and neither did His words."", ""In its overt approach to religious themes, the film often feels akin to Clint Eastwood westerns, namely Pale Rider. Interestingly, it includes a few links to those films. Not only is Eli a drifter who comes into this small town built around a water supply, but he sees a nameless woman be attacked and does not act to save her. Later, he saves Solara from the same situation. With the latter coming off similarly to Eastwood saving a woman from rape in Pale Rider, Eli similarly punishes the man according to Matthew 5:30, which reads, \""And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to depart into hell\"". Though he does not cut off this man's hand - though he does cut off another man's hand earlier in the film for similarly sinning by using his hands to kill others - he does shoot an arrow through his groin. A man arising to save the world from absolute darkness, Eli's mission is one that will test, but unlike Eastwood in films such as High Plains Drifter or Pale Rider, Hell does not ride with Eli. Rather, it is God that rides with Eli. Having Eli read from the Book of Genesis late on in the film, the film shows that this is truly the first Book of the New New Testament."" ]";5

The animation is also great and I really enjoyed the look and feel of the film. On top of that, this one is very Wes Anderson in terms of the way it was filmed and in the story itself, as on the surface it is about a fox who steals chickens and other things from nearby farmers, but it goes much deeper than that, allowing it to be a great film for all ages to enjoy.

Their humor is quirky, but it usually works for me and far too many jokes fell flat. The deadpan comedy worked for the most part, but just not enough. Plus, this one was just constantly feeling like a film I would appreciate more if I were Jewish. It felt like I was constantly on the outside looking in and everybody behind the cameras kept dying of laughter and I had no idea why they kept laughing. A Serious Man, as a drama, works very well and is a very interesting take on the expectations of life, being in a downward spiral, and on the book of Job. From a religious aspect, it is very sound and an interesting take on what is expected of believers, especially when things do not work out. Sadly, it feels too distant and almost incomplete (though all their films do....to varying effectiveness) to be truly effective. A Serious Man had high expectations from me, but it fell short."" ]";5

1184;observe-and-report;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Ever watch a movie and realize you are wildly incapable of putting together your thoughts on what you just watched? Well, that was me with Observe and Report. A disturbing look at a man suffering from extreme mental illness and rife with dark jokes and dark scenes (date rape...). That said, the film can be quite funny at times and is reminiscent of a lesser Taxi Driver-esque look at those suffering from violent mood swings and violent inclinations such as Seth Rogen in this film. Rogen is very good in the lead role and encapsulates this delusion and the man different sides of Ronnie. Though he can be quite awkward and creepy, this is all part of his character and can be very tough to watch. Essentially, Ronnie is a very good antihero and thoroughly unreliable narrator. You can be misled into rooting for him many times, even if his actions dictate that he is certainly not the hero of this tale. Overall, Observe and Report is never quite as funny as it thinks it is, but the dark picture portrays of its protagonist/antihero is richly rewarding and thoroughly disturbing. Observe and Report plays less as a comedy and more as a drama about a man who suffers from a serious mental illness and for that, it really hits hard at times. Unfortunately, its tone is all over the place and the film can never decide whether it wants to horrify you, make you laugh, or extract drama and tears from the situation. For this inconsistent tone, the film winds up being only slightly above average. If it remained more focused, it could have been far better."" ]";5

Sam Rockwell is great and I love Kevin Spacey's voice acting here (the robot voiced by Spacey is 110% influenced by HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey). The special effects were also incredibly cool, but were not the focus, rather the focus of this one was on the story and Rockwell, to great effect. The effects were certainly great in a more \""supporting\"" role though. In addition, this futuristic world is very well developed and established, which makes the story feel incredibly believeable. The story is also very interesting and well put together, so kudos to Jones for the script and his direction. However, I never really saw why this one has become an obsession for many.

Amy Adams and Emily Blunt are great here and really have good chemistry. Alan Arkin also does well as is typically the case. The film suffers from the trappings of being a small film that certainly limit its scope, as it does feel small in nature, but it is certainly still quite successful. Director Christine Jeffs does a good job in the director's chair and this one is well written, well plotted, and well shot. An entirely unique film in terms of its plot, it does hit many markers when it comes to emotional comedy-dramas, but all the same, the unique focus of the plot really sets this one aside. However, this one's strongest attribute is the way in which it acts as a vehicle for Adams and Blunt to show their strength as leads in a film.

Just as engaging as Tykwer's past films, The International examines the corrupt activities of a bank and uses it as a moralistic play when it comes to reality and the way bankers seem to get away with everything. For this, the film can be somewhat unsatisfying due to its lack of pay off, which many will find problematic, though I thoroughly loved the ending. The cinematography is very good, as in all of Tykwer's films and really gives the film this stylish, sexy look. That said, there are problems. The one major action set piece is really, really dumb. Like, earth-shatteringly dumb. Additionally, it can be hard to follow. Not too hard to follow, but there is certainly some confusion along the way. All in all, The International is a stylish thriller with an overly complicated story, an ending that I liked but many will not, and can be quite implausible at times.

1188;duplicity;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A stylish, yet flawed, romantic crime comedy, Duplicity is a mixed bag. With compelling twists and a great look at corporate espionage, this film from director Tony Gilroy is bogged down by a nonlinear narrative and a lackluster romance. As a result, the plot becomes hard to follow when the film jumps from the past to the present to the past constantly and, towards the end, stops helping you figure out where each scene is taking place. Even worse, these flashbacks are always dry, humorless, and chemistry-less when they put together former MI6 agent Ray Koval (Clive Owen) and former CIA agent Claire Stenwick (Julia Roberts). Lovers who work for competing companies, the film details the efforts of both sides to outwit the other and beat them in the marketplace. Of course, that is when the couple are not having sex in an exotic location."", ""For the positives, as a business major, I loved the corporate espionage. Okay, business is really, really boring. However, this film triggered why I am okay with working in this world. The anticipation of new products, studying the competition, and going to war, are all incredibly compelling to watch unfold. Of course, real life pales in comparison and is largely quite dull. Duplicity, however, manages to make a shareholder meeting completely compelling. With the cure for baldness on the way, who will be the first to the marketplace? Only time will find out, but there are moles and spies on both sides that make the battle between former business partners, portrayed by Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti, the highlight of the film. Honestly, Owen and Roberts should be cut out of this film in favor of the more compelling story. Two former business partners going to war with one another over a breakthrough with corporate espionage and a fractured relationship between them. For those that have seen this film, tell me that is not the more compelling tale? Unfortunately, strewn in between these great sections are a lot of romantic moments between spies that merely further complicate the film. Having them repeat lines, jumping back in time to just show them have sex, showing their distrust, and showing some of their planning, Duplicity struggles to bring life to its romantic moments. While its crime elements are top-notch and slick, the romance is lifeless. Owen and Roberts try, but putting two people that audiences find appealing together and hoping it will work is a bad idea. As a result, the romance here is largely unappealing and passionless. While some moments do add to the final reveal, the film could cut out all of the romance scenes, aside from the few where they plot their own espionage, and lose nothing. As for the comedy here, it largely fails and I had to keep reminding myself that it was supposed to be a comedy. With the romance and comedy elements failing, it leaves just the crime portion as being any good. As mentioned, this crime portion does succeed terrifically with a twisty and unpredictable sequence of events. Here, Wilkinson and Giamatti nail their limited roles and demand to be explored deeper. Clive Owen and Julia Roberts also do quite well in the film, even in the romance scenes. However, they both really soar when being calculating and cold spies. In particular, Owen is great using his charisma and slick nature to woo marks and complete tasks. In addition to the fun corporate espionage, watching this duo do their job is worth the watch and thoroughly entertaining."", ""Stylistically, the film is pretty compelling. It is hard to describe the technique Tony Gilroy uses when flashing back or jumping forward again. It is not a split screen, rather he takes a shot and begins to slowly shrink the frame. Other shots may appear and one will then grow. It is pretty unique and not too bad to look at. Honestly, I am hard pressed to think of a film off the top of my head with a similar technique and I am not sure what it would be called. That said, I just wish it did not signal my least favorite moments were about to happen again or else I would have really loved the technique."", ""A messy and flawed romantic crime comedy, Duplicity is not really funny or romantic. However, its crime and spy elements are so good, it allows me to look past its flaws to a degree. With great style and the assured hand of Gilroy, Duplicity may be a bit contrived and cliched, but it remains unpredictable through unforeseen twists that show just how dirty this corporate rivalry has become."" ]";5

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are brilliant in the leads, while Michael Shannon repeatedly stole scenes here in a stellar performance. This film's writing is out of this world as it crafts some seriously deep characters with relatable personas and, somehow, all of this relationship tension really makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand. Somehow Mendes managed to craft almost a thriller at times with the way the drama here made you sit on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happened next. Ultimately, Revolutionary Road is a gut punch that picks you up and punches you in the gut repeatedly. It is a film that will leave you feeling entirely depressed, but damn is it ever a good movie with even better acting and writing.

Director Sam Raimi creates a thoroughly unsettling atmosphere and a great accompanying score and sound effects really help to create that mood. Drag Me to Hell was heavily criticized upon its release for being too silly and not being scary enough. I disagree on both accounts. Obviously I thought it was scary, but I never found any of it comedic. There were moments that broke the tension and were kind of funny, but that happens in every movie. Here, the few funny moments were intended and the scary moments were effective.

When I finished this one, I was absolutely floored and was on the brink of tears with my jaw hanging on the floor; I was that moved and that shocked by what I had just watched. Incredibly weird and at times almost unsettling, Synecdoche, New York is a tough nut to crack. However, before moving into my interpretation, let me discuss what I love so much. The direction, for one, is brilliant. Charlie Kaufman truly made his vision for this film into his own and in just one film, he has become one of my favorite directors. The acting is beyond brilliant. Delicate in nature and so artistic, it is just a treat to watch. The set design and writing are both of the highest order just are both impactful in their own unique ways. Truly a beautiful film in every sense of the word."", """", ""**SPOILERISH FROM NOW ON**"", ""Now, this one can mean many things to many different people. I do not doubt that there are many interpretations of this one with all of them being right in their own way. For me, this was a film about life in every form: love, happiness, hope, betrayal, sadness, loneliness, and death, basically every element that make up every single person's life. Not only are our individual struggles not unique, but they are widespread. Everyone will go through all of those things in their life and while it may feel incredibly important to us in the moment, in the grand scheme of things, it means very little if anything at all. However, this sense of importance is what makes life almost like a play. After thinking about what I thought the film meant, I saw a quote by Shakespeare that essentially said that we are all the lead in our play, which is also something mentioned in the film itself. As depicted in the film with the continuous casting of new actors in the protagonist's play and the growing scope of the set, we all come together and play a role in the play that is life. We all mean something different to every person we come across and play many different roles in our life and embody many different personas."", ""**SPOILERS END**"", """", ""But, what do I know?

Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe are great, Mark Strong's performance is also strong, while Oscar Isaac has a good turn as well. Ridley Scott's direction is also good as usual. The story us interesting and quite compelling for surs. The action is also done very well, which is nice. In addition, the cinematography and the sets are good, making the imagery really nice and the locations believable. However, there are two major problems with this one. First, the script is poor. While the overall story is good, the telling of it is very convoluted and can be hard to follow at times. This is not helped by it being hard to hear some characters at times. In addition, the few scenes of torture are a little much for my liking. They are effective, but would have still been so if toned down just a little bit. Overall, Body of Lies is a solid action spy thriller sporting killer acting performances and an entertaining premise, which make the film an enjoyable one to watch.

An incredibly well-written film, Milk moves elegantly through the man's life and manages to focus on the movement he helped to create while also adequately covering the most important decade of his life. Sean Penn is a revelation here as he completely becomes the titular character and brings a certain charisma and charm to the role that demonstrates brilliantly why Milk was a popular figure amongst all citizens. Often times, biopics struggle to be truly engaging and entertaining due to its events actually occurring. This is most certainly not an issue with Milk as it is a brilliantly entertaining film from beginning to end and hits you with every emotional uppercut in its story with full force.

An at times truly disturbing film, Let the Right One In also manages to be very emotionally impactful as you watch this relationship blossom between a lonely 12-year-old boy and a vampire girl. Very well-written, Let the Right One In treats both its subjects with incredible respect and extends the same respect to vampires and the genre it sits in. It may not be the scariest horror movie ever, but it definitely is a horror movie that has a deep respect for the genre. Tomas Alfredson does a fantastic job with the direction of this one, crafting a film that rides on atmosphere and tension when it does create scares, but he also shows a great non-reliance on scaring his audience outright. Rather, he is willing let you into the world's of the protagonists and see them for the disturbing (yet innocent) individuals they truly are. For a vampire movie, it also managed to not be very gory, which I appreciate. There is some blood obviously and some pretty gruesome scenes, but they are minimal and do not last long. Finally, the cinematography and imagery here are impeccable. Truly a beautiful made film that shows a mastery of the art, Let the Right One In is a horror film of the highest order."" ]";5

The tricks it pretended to have up its sleeve with not nearly worth it or downright predictable. At their worst, the plot elements in the second half become outlandish and wildly implausible, plus without reasonable explanation as to how certain things happen. Instead, the film opts to rush its ending a bit and skip ahead, but the pieces it skips would make the ending actually make more sense. Instead, the film is emotionally distant and keeps the audience at an arm's length, keeping us in the dark while it feels as though the characters know more than we ever will. That said, the film half is very well executed and incredibly tense. The acting is good throughout, plus the cinematography is quite good and the production design is very strong, especially aboard the train.

1197;rachel-getting-married;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Utter brilliance. Born straight out of cinema verite and Dogme 95, Jonathan Demme's Rachel Getting Married opens with a scene reminiscent of Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless in which Kym (Anne Hathaway) is picked up from rehab by her father Paul (Bill Irwin). Putting the camera in the car and immediately making the audience an intimate part of this story and this family, this sequence uses a few jump cuts akin to that Godard film and the plot that plays out feels like a spiritual successor to Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration. Putting Kym in the throws of her sister Rachel (Rosemarie Dewitt) getting married, the resultant film is powerful, engrossing, and a  truly brilliant experience. The decision to use cinema verite - documentary-style filmmaking - as the main source  of camerawork in Rachel Getting Married is an absolutely brilliant choice by Demme. Instead of just a film about a recovering drug addict arriving home and causing chaos wherever she goes, Rachel Getting Married is an intimate experience. The pain of the characters becomes our pain. Awkward moments are felt. We cry, we laugh, we smile, and we get angry with the characters. All out of love. By the end of the film, this family has become our own. Spending two hours with them feels like a lifetime, as the audience is given such an intimate look at their struggles, past pain, and joy. These characters on display in Rachel Getting Married are beautifully written and achingly real. The situations they find themselves are equally so. By using the documentary-style filmmaking, we are the one's holding the camera. Floating by without fear of using extreme close-ups - which have the added benefit of making us feel even closer to the action - the camera is a tool of intimacy in the film and one that creates a world so authentic, so within reach, it is as if we are not just a fly on the wall. The audience has become a silent family member, sitting by and watching the action unfold without feeling the need to speak out. This manifests itself in making the film feel personal and the characters are our family. I want to reach out to Kym, see how she is doing. Call Rachel and ask how the marriage is and what she is up to nowadays. How is the baby? I want to call Paul, just chat about music or whatever. Rachel Getting Married turns itself into the Buchman family's own home video and one that fills the audience with odd feelings of nostalgia and familiarity."", ""What truly helps to sell the authenticity and broken reality of the film is the acting. As the broken Kym, Hathaway is a revelation. Raw and immature, her Kym is self-centered, self-loathing, and eternally depressed. Responsible for the death of her younger brother because of her drug addiction, she will never forgive herself, further feeding into her spiral into drugs and alcohol. She is a beautiful soul, but one that will never blossom to her potential because of her past sins. Hathaway plays a recovering drug addict that, in spite of how many times she missteps during the film, makes you root for her. The audience can see her good heart and her desire to forgive herself, but she can simply not get over that mountain and continuously acts out to try and cry out for help. Hathaway is brilliant is portraying this complex and deeply moving character."", ""Yet, her family is also at the top of their game. As her father Paul, Bill Irwin is tremendous. Emotional and constantly trying to parent Kym, knowing how fragile she is, Paul is a good man but has trouble forgiving his daughter for being under the influence, leading to the death of his young son. Outwardly, he forgives her, but you can see just how much Ethan's death hurts him and merely seeing his name causes him to breakdown mentally and emotionally. Along the same lines, Kym's sister Rachel is terrifically brought to life by Rosemarie Dewitt. Elated over her marriage and completely loving towards her sisters, she is constantly driven to the edge by her sister's antics. As Kym self-destructs and draws attention to herself, Rachel is driven away, but never leaves. She always comes back, culminating in a beautiful hug shared between them at the end. Chills. No matter what they go through, they will always be sisters and the both of them will go to the end of the world for one another. Of all the film's accomplishments, this portrayal of sisterhoods may be one of its most defiant triumphs. Authentic and showing how one can go between loving and hating their troublesome siblings in an instant, it is never exploitative and never feels scripted. These are real people and scenarios that are merely being reenacted for this film."", ""What reveals the brilliance of Rachel Getting Married, however, is the final shot. Parking the camera on the porch as Rachel looks out at the remaining wedding guests the day after as they gather around a man playing a guitar, it is a scene that makes you want to walk out there with Rachel."" ]";5
1198;hellboy-ii-the-golden-army;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A thrilling and fantastical return to the Bureau of Paranoramal Research and Defense, Hellboy II: The Golden Army is far less gothic than its predecessor and, in focusing more on the fantasy element, is a great improvement on its already strong first entry. Far more in Guillermo del Toro's wheelhouse as more of a fantastical fairy tale with fairies, elves, and children reading those very same fairy tales, Hellboy II: The Golden Army starts off with informing the audience about the war between humans and elves. Born with a hole in their heart that is filled with earthly possessions, humanity sought to wipe out every other being on Earth. The only ones standing in their way were the elves who raised a golden army that was indestructible. Destroying the humans in numbers that disturbed the Elf King, a truce was reached for the elves to stay in the forest with two pieces of the golden crown that controls the Golden Army and the humans to stay in the cities with one piece of the crown. However, when elvish Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) returns and is determined to raise the Golden Army to wipe out humanity, it is on Hellboy and the gang to save the world once again."", ""Central to this work is the role of Hellboy and his other supernatural friends in this world of humanity. However, it is largely through the guise of exploring those who are different. In his work, Del Toro is known for exploring creativity, fairy tales, those with their heads in the clouds, and those who are different from others for these reasons - namely Pan's Labyrinth and now again in The Shape of Water, as examples - and here, in Hellboy II, he firmly establishes this group as one of outsiders. Hellboy is equated to Frankenstein's monster as the people accuse him of harming a child even though they can plainly see he did not. Abe Sapien is equated to the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Liz (Selma Blair) feels \""looked at\"" and scrutinized due to her fire-based abilities. The trio feel excluded and like outsiders to the world around them, yet they fight for this world all the same. Though they feel rejected and like outcasts, their wish to fit in is one that overwhelms them. Yet, at the core of it all, is their belief that there should be no boundaries. Abe falls in love with the Elf Princess. Hellboy and Liz are in love. There is inter-species romance in the air and this eclectic group of weirdos embrace these differences. Though rejected by the humans, they nonetheless fight for them because they love their differences, respect them, and wish to protect them and their culture when it is under attack."", ""It is for this same reason that Hellboy struggles to kill a god of the forest and, later, the dangerous elf Prince. Waging war on the humans to maintain their own culture, the elves' cause is one that Hellboy sympathizes with entirely. The prince plays on this sympathy and continuously tries to win him over to his side, warning that the humans will never accept him and his differences. Yet, to Hellboy and the others, the humans are not the ones waging war. Though they may, that is not their concern in the present. Rather, no matter what pull they feel to defend the elves, they must defend those that they are entrusted to protect and those that have remained peaceful to other species in recent times. In the end, for this bad of misfits, the most important thing is acceptance, peace, and understanding. Those who wage war must go as their anti-cultural beliefs are ones that do not gel with them - see the Nazis in the first film - and though they wish to fight for all cultures to remain, there is a line to not cross that the elves have very flippantly disregarded."", ""In this regard, the film perfectly uses the \""end of the world\"" trope that has often maligned superhero films in recent years. Though the elvish prince does wish to unleash the Golden Army on humanity that would certainly wipe them out, the film has it all make sense. Rather than some nonsensical plot where it becomes clear that the villain has nothing but blood lust, the backstory and development of the elvish prince allows us to understand his plight perfectly. As a result, he is a strong villain as though reject his actions, his reasoning and cause are ones that are rather noble. Viewing his father's actions as ones that have eliminated the elves from the world, he wishes to restore his culture as one to be proud of and one that instills great respect wherever it travels. His violent ways are not the right path, but his cause makes sense and his method of rectifying these wrongs make sense as well. In essence, it often doubles as a symbol of nuclear warfare. With certain destruction of the enemy when using the Golden Army, one must exercise great caution in using the weapon. Yet, as with the Americans and Soviets, the elvish prince is fighting for a way of life and a culture. He is willing to press the red button and unleash the army to do so. As a result, he must be stopped even if his"" ]";5

The whole heist and everything surrounding it was quite thrilling and, as I said, it was well directed and well acted, however, the non-heist portions and non-controversial parts, kind of fell flat. The amount of webs it weaves is entirely worth watching this one though, because it does quite well. It introduces many scenarios that could overwhelm, yet finds a way to keep its wits about it and not overwhelm its viewers.

Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell are great together here and have great chemistry as brothers who are asked to kill somebody in return for great financial gain. Though the morality play the film poses and the theme of family relationships may be unoriginal, Allen never fails to elicit tension and thrills along the way, with his two leads game to follow his lead. There is nothing wrong with a genre film and Cassandra's Dream certainly fits the bill as both a drama and a thriller. It executes its well-worn cliches to perfection, while entertaining in spades. Though its ending may be predictable to some, it does not lose its impact and can be quite spellbinding in the lead up as you watch these brothers grapple with the ramifications of the decisions they make; both positive and negative.

However, this one is totally different and takes the best of their past films (in particular, this one feels similar to Fargo, though funnier) and puts it together with some great laughs. As is typical, the writing is great and the direction here is very good. the acting is also good, especially from Pitt, Frances McDormand, and George Clooney.

A depressing and dark film, Corbijn's black and white film with killer cinematography breathes life into a film that would otherwise be a pretty typical musician biopic. Okay, it is still a typical musician biopic, but it does look really good. Telling the story of the rise and fall of Curtis, including his infidelity and epilepsy that led to his suicide in 1980, the film is a truly harrowing journey. The serves not just as a showcase for Corbijn, but also his actors led by Sam Riley as Curtis, Toby Kebbell as the band manager Rob Gretton, and Samantha Morton as Curtis' wife Deborah. Together, even when the film slows, the trio makes the film eminently watchable."", """", ""However, the star here remains the cinematography. In particular, there is a shot through a window of Curtis with the reflection of what he can see in the mirror. A truly striking shot, it is a microcosm of this beautiful film. The black and white adds a degree of character to the film that makes it feel appropriate for the era, with this smokiness to every shot. Who better to add late 1970s British rock scene touches to the film than Corbijn, who has become far more well known for his work in the world of music than in film."", """", ""In terms of acting, Control is a real showcase. Sam Riley plays Curtis brilliantly. Through each sequence, you can see the darkness closing in on him as he spirals further and further out of control. Though he tries to escape, there was never any hope for the man as the walls closed in all around. At home, he had broken his relationship with Deborah. On the road, he felt extreme guilt when he slept with Belgian journalist Annik Honore (Alexandra Maria Lara). With the band, his epilepsy wreaked havoc while Joy Division gained more and more notoriety that he could not cope with. Riley brings these elements to life in his portrayal of Curtis and it makes his transformation from a typically energetic teenager to a dark and depressed man in his early 20s all the more harrowing. As the band manager, Kebbell is energetic and truly charismatic. Whenever he is on the screen, his performance makes the character truly magnetic. As Curtis' wife, Samantha Morton plays a heartbroken and tormented Deborah. Her brilliance is subtle throughout the film, but truly realized in the final sequence when she finds Ian dead. Her emotion and power as we hear her find him is a terrific close to the film."", """", ""Yet, Control is not perfect. Far too slow and moody, Control feels emotionally distant from beginning to end. Though Curtis certainly was a distant person, this does not make for a great film. While there is more than enough to like about Control in spite of this distance, it does prevent it from becoming an even better film. As a result of this distance, the film also feels incredibly cold. When things happen, except for at the end, it lacks the emotional punch required to make the film a truly lasting experience. Instead, Control winds up being a good biopic of Curtis with great acting and cinematography, but no lasting power."", """", ""As a whole, Control is a good film that could have been better if it let us into its world a bit more. That said, it remains a terrific look at the harrowing descent experienced by Ian Curtis that culminated in his suicide at the age of 23.

It is ultimately a beautiful look at family relationships and hardships faced by family throughout our lives. The film has a certain tenderness and heartfeltness that truly pulls you in and makes you feel one with the characters. It also does not hurt if you have had a loved one in this situation, as this film certainly hits home for many. While it is not a happy film, The Savages is a very good, even if depressing, film that really hits all of its marks.

The characters all also very well-written and feel like authentic 16 year olds. The direction from Jason Reitman is also very good and the story is very well told here. The title sequence was also one of the coolest I have seen. I usually do not notice that too much, but here, it was really well done and the music was perfect for it. Finally, I typically do not find comedies that funny for whatever reason, but here, I was laughing quite often. The film was a great blend of drama and comedy and it was refreshing for me to find a film that I found to be 50/50 in that regard, rather than a dramedy that never really makes me laugh.

At its worst, it is an anti-Muslim film that plays far too much into action movie cliches. The positives largely come in the first half, in which the film is far more detective-based as this group of FBI agents head to Saudi Arabia to investigate who perpetrated a bombing in the American compound in the country. Here, the writing is quite good and the film showcases just how much the Saudis hate the terrorists as well. However, it seems as though director Peter Berg thought this was boring and decided it was best for the final half hour to turn into a shoot 'em up action movie that demonizes the Saudis and half hazardly tries to show some of their humanity, only to revert to concluding that everyone - even children - are evil anti-Americans. This is unfortunate, but luckily does not completely wipe out the positives of the first half, in which the film is a very compelling and interesting look at determining the guilty parties behind such an awful attack.

Truly, the two of them together provide powerhouse performances that should have been Oscar worthy. The film also excels in the areas of costume and production design. A film that spans multiple decades and includes scenes on the English countryside and in the north of France during WWII, this one's production design is impeccable. The writing and directing here are also quite strong, but one of my favorite elements here was the cinematography. Coupled with the entire mise en scene, war has never looked so beautiful.

Charlie Cox does a great job, as do Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert De Niro, and I loved the small role for Ricky Gervais. The prince brothers are also quite good and all very entertaining. The film is a well-written fairy tale and really lifts you up into this fantastical world where anything is truly possible. In this fashion, the film is very well-written and does fairy tale incredibly well. Stardust is as enchanting as it should be and is a beautifully romantic film with incredibly unique elements in its corner. However, in the negative, the ending is telegraphed from a mile away. The second the film began, anybody walking in could tell you how it was going to end, especially the big \""twist\"" at the end. Did they think they were being discreet in hiding it? While the writing is solid, the film seems often too concerned in following the story structure of a classical fairy tale story instead of blazing its own trail and saying something mildly unique. Instead of profundity, we find nothing but \""love conquers all\"". A nice message sure, but damn is it ever repeated a lot. With Stardust, I am entirely stuck between being swept up in the fantasy it conjures and writing it off as a wholly derivative and insipid experience. Thus, I am truly perplexed about my own feelings on the film. I would call it \""mixed\"", but the film feels better than just this. However, even \""mixed\"" sounds too good for a film like this. My opinion on Stardust will likely never be finite until I sit down and watch it again, but for now, I am left feeling completely underwhelmed at this pretty poorly paced, yet sometimes decidedly magical and enchanting film. If it could figure out what it wanted to be, maybe my task here would be a far simpler one."" ]";5
1214;eastern-promises;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Featuring terrific performances from Viggo Mortensen, Vincent Cassel, and Naomi Watts, Eastern Promises is more than your typical crime/gangster film. Their Russian accents are very good and convincing, while their chemistry is also very noticeable. The performances are just one element of a very strong thriller directed by the always dependable David Cronenberg. The story itself is very unique and developed, the characters are all very well-written and truly come to life on the screen. You feel like this is your neighorhood entirely. At times, it can definitely get a little graphic, but for example, one scene that is very bloody and graphic is so well shot and choreographed that you cannot really get mad at that excessive violence. As a whole, Eastern Promises is a very thrilling gangster film and while I kind of pieced together the ending, it is was still very interesting and really a nice little twist at the end that differentiates it from other gangster flicks."" ]";5

The acting and singing from the entire cast is very good and this is truly a role only Johnny Depp could play. Brilliantly shot and designed, the film is simply beautiful to look at with some seriously killer costumes to be found here. Tim Burton really hits a home run with the direction of this film, managing the extreme gore with the emotional element at the center of the story, as well as not overdoing it with the musical numbers. The ones that are here are exceptionally well done, but luckily it never feels like overkill. Above all though, I fell in love with the look and feel of the film. Truly, it was really beautiful.

Both Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling, the latter of which I am not typically a huge fan of, did fantastic and really made for really interesting leads. On top of it, the plot was absolutely gripping and really had you guessing as to how it would end (however it does become clear towards the end). However, the film is never really great. At many turns, it is quite good, but really, it is just a solid entry in both Hopkins and Gosling's filmographies. The film certainly is not Oscar worthy, but it is still very entertaining largely thanks to its two leads who really are at the root of why this film is successful. Without them, it really would have fallen flat, even with the compelling storyline."" ]";5

I don't know what that means, but it just does. Trust me. The acting is great and authentic. John Carney's direction is very natural and really contributes to the authentic feeling of the film. The music is absolutely gorgeous and entirely infectious. Watching the music come together is fantastic. I also like the narrative structure, which is not there at all. Yet, I like that. Though it can feel a little directionless and feels incomplete, it is essentially designed as a slice of life film. Of course it does not feel complete. Though not quite a great film, Once is still wonderfully crafted and a truly enjoyable experience for a viewer.

The suspense and thrills of the spy genre are also here and in full force. This one manages to keep you on the edge of your seat without multiple action sequences and shootouts. It is a film built on tension and shows you how to create it without those scenes. As such, the direction from Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is great, as is the script from him. Both his direction and the writing are top-notch. As with all foreign films, the fact that is in another language can be a barrier of entry for some, but for me, this one felt like it was in English. I barely even noticed they were speaking German I was so engrossed in the story. In addition, the ending is fantastic and really brings everything to a wrap nicely. As a whole, this one is deserving of the praise it has received and stands as one of the best spy films of the past 10 years."" ]";5

While the shaky cam can certainly be a bit too much at times, the film is just so well done otherwise that it is impossible to ignore. Matt Damon turns in a traditionally top-notch performance in his famed role as CIA assassin Jason Bourne. However, the direction from Paul Greengrass is what takes centerstage. Well paced, thrilling, and well told the film is never hard to follow, which is impressive. For many action spy films, the number of moving parts can become truly overwhelming. Under Greengrass' assured direction, however, this is never a problem. Instead, the story is coherent and truly entertaining. As with the other Bourne films, the action is stylish and well choreographed and firmly establishes Mr. Bourne as a man you do not want to encounter.

It is also really well told and developed, as the story really unfolds nicely and, as I mentioned already, it is very interesting. There is a real intensity in this one as, while you know what happens, you keep waiting for that shoe to drop and for them to get their guy. The way the story was told also seemed pretty fair. While Robert Hanssen is undeniably a traitor and perverted, there is a good guy in there somewhere and the film includes those moments, which I found to be a plus. The way the story stuck largely to the facts is another big plus as it really was authentic and it felt almost as if we were watching the real thing unveil before our eyes. The only major negative I can think of is the pacing. For the first 40 minutes, the pacing is glacial at best, which challenges your attention greatly. While interesting, it struggles to get going, but once it does, this one is definitely a winner."" ]";5
1222;harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix finally delivers on the promise of the series. The fifth entry in the beloved saga set in Hogwarts, Order of the Phoenix continues the trend of directors changing in this beloved franchise. Yet, for the first time, a director finally corrects the issue plaguing the success of the films: the length. Streamlining the story and focusing only on the portions that actually impact the story and the climactic battle, Yates turns Order of the Phoenix into far-and-away the best film in the franchise thus far. Able to focus on the story, use the already established characters perfectly, and introduce new ones into the fold, Yates is able to make this a sequel less rooted in the series' original innocence and youth, but rather a far more mature effort out of pure necessity. No longer able to stick their head in the sand and refuse to see what is going in the world around them, the students of Hogwarts must grow up and take charge when the adults will not. As such, their youth is becoming abridged and they must grow up overnight. In Order of the Phoenix, they are able to do just that."", ""In narrowing duff the fluff and childish elements such as the Quidditch, Yates is able to make Order of the Phoenix a strong thematic work. Dealing with numerous themes, the film may be a bit obvious in their dealings with characters coming right out and saying what it all means, but the film nonetheless handles it well. Plus, its overt and blunt nature can be easily explained by the audience it is targeting: young teens. Ensuring that they get the message about good and evil being in all of us, leaving it up to us to decide what to become, is heard and understand far exceeds any need for subtlety. That said, strong writing and acting - especially from Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon who are largely tasked with pointing Harry in the right direction by way of the film's themes - make the themes rousing and powerfully realized. Watching Harry struggle between both sides and having to rely upon his friends and their love for him to overcome it all is powerful, moving, and incredibly resonant. Where the film could become preachy or cloying, it instead becomes a momentous achievement for a franchise seeking firm footing. In Yates, it finds this with the man able to balance the youth of the characters with the wisdom they must possess to succeed that will tear away their innocence."", ""In exploring its themes of good and evil, the film draws an interesting parallel to Lucifer in its depiction of Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs). His name is obviously a dead giveaway of this fact, but as he tempts Harry with the ability to see and rule over the world, it becomes rather interesting. As a death-eater, Lucius does the bidding of Voldemort, so then how could he be Lucifer? While odd on the surface, it makes a lot of sense. Lucifer is like any other being swayed by evil and temptation. Once good, he is led astray to becoming more evil than good and seeks to destroy others along with himself. Yet, absolute evil - or, in the context of the film, Voldemort - led to him to betray himself and his honor. In portraying Lucius/Lucifer as merely a supporter of the absolute evil in the film, Order of the Phoenix shows some subtle nuance that is unexpected, but smartly constructed."", ""However, this show is really all about the battle. With Yates' approach focusing on important details to the plot over developing already developed characters, Order of the Phoenix manages to efficiently and strongly build-up to its climax. With Rocky-esque montages defining the opening hour of this film as the students learn the Dark Arts to defend themselves from Voldemort, Order of the Phoenix constantly builds to the moment where it puts those students in the position to actually use their newly developed skills. Furthermore, with the depth of their training and the constant ominous dread regarding Voldemort's return lurking in the background, it is hard not to get caught up in the tension and thrill of what is upcoming. When the climactic battle finally arrives, it lives up to every bit of tension and anticipation in both this film and the series as a whole. Exciting and leaving you on the edge of your seat, the only word to accurately describe this battle is \""epic\"". In scope, feeling, and design, every bit of this battle is epic. As the kids run through the building and fight the Death-Eaters, as the Order of the Phoenix arrives to fight the Death-Eaters, and as Voldemort and Dumbledore square off with one another, the film delivers thrills and excitement like the series has yet to see. In the first five films, it is hard to find a better constructed scene in terms of fight choreography, special effects, or in direction. It is a thrilling cap to the film that satisfies the tension of this film and builds additional amounts up for its successors. It is the kind of sequence that makes you crave more time in the Wizarding World."" ]";5
1223;the-good-german;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""In contrast to the bad reviews, I thought The Good German was actually quite brilliant. Director Steven Soderbergh incorporates so much period detail to this 1940s noir throwback, it almost hurts. Aside from the actors (who make it obvious the film is from the 2000s), the film looks entirely like a film from the 1940s. The lighting, quality, editing, and story structure, are 100% 1940s noir. Additionally, the costume and production design are very good and are quite period accurate for 1940s Germany. In terms of acting, Cate Blanchett steals the show. She is absolutely brilliant as usual. Clooney also does a good job here. Much criticism was placed on the characterization, but I thought the characters were fine. They had well explained pasts, goals, and characteristics. I could not really ask for much more on that front. In terms of the story, it was wholly engrossing. The mystery was truly mysterious and I did not know how things would wind up or what the big reveals would actually state. To me, the film's plot almost threatens to steal the show over the style because it is that interesting and engaging. It can be hard to follow at times, but things do clear up and you are able to catch up no problem. Overall, The Good German was criticized heavily upon its release, but I would argue it is in need of a critical reappraisal."" ]";5

The film depicts the after effects of a nuclear tests that has resulted in huge killer ants. Apparently, after years of being stepped on and killed with ant bait, the species was pissed at humans and were not afraid to show it. 52 years later, the same phenomenon arose in South Korea. Except, it presented the chance for fish to exact their revenge on humanity after millenia of being prey. And exact revenge is certainly the only thing this fish monster is interested in. Created as a result of an American scientist's unwillingness to properly dispose of formaldehyde, this fish is out to wreak havoc on the race that brought it into existence in the name of all of its fish friends. The Host is a truly thrilling, emotionally moving, oddly funny, and expertly executed science fiction film with clear political undertones."", """", ""Often times, films such as that offer some emotional moments wind up being far too sentimental. Bong Joon-ho avoids this trap by showcasing real, raw emotion. The pain showcased by all of the characters and the family bonds that are tested through these traumatic events bring an incredible sense of realism. These moments are not overdone or overly emotional. Rather, they are impassioned, low-key, and subtle. What is not subtle, however, is the love held by Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) for his daughter Park Hyun-seo (Go Ah-sung). The two's love for one another as father and daughter is terrifically developed and feels authentic to the point that when things go awry for the two, your heart bleeds for them."", """", ""The emotional authenticity is just one solid element of this film, as the entirety of the characters are well developed. Though there is not a ton of depth given the type of film this is, what is introduced is always purposeful and used later on in the climax. This is emblematic of how tight this film is with very little filler, both in dialogue and in the general plot. The film shows us what it needs to in order for us to understand what is occurring. There are very few, if any, moments that really feel out of place or do not add to the story. While every scene is obviously not perfect, they all have a purpose and flow together incredibly well. Heck, even the odd moments of comedy tossed in the film, particularly in the refugee camp, work out pretty well and do showcase elements of the characters."", """", ""Cinematography-wise, there are a few scenes that stood out to me as being particularly well shot, namely the shot during the protest as agent yellow is released. The shot of the group of people standing with \""Free Park Gang-du\"" shirts and being overtaken by agent yellow is tragic and beautifully executed. The shot itself is incredibly well framed with terrific use of color. Additionally, the final shot of the snack bar set against the ocean as snow falls to the ground was incredibly beautiful."", """", ""Politically, the message is clear: Bong Joon-ho does not like American or outside influence in South Korea. The military, American personnel in Korea, the doctors, and even the CDC are all shown negatively for exploiting the Koreans and not caring about what happens to them. Instead, they are shown as being more obsessed with Americans, their needs, and how it will effect the United States should any possible monster or virus appear in North America. The name \""agent yellow\"" especially drives this home as it draws a direct link to Agent Orange in Vietnam and the disastrous effects it had on the Vietnamese and Americans in the country. Though Americans may not be literally killing Koreans at this point, it is clear that Bong Joon-ho is fearful that if their present level of indifference continues, the day in which Koreans die because of Americans is not far off. Thus, the film is not explicitly anti-American to me. Rather, it is a warning of what could happen and something that both sides should be aware of and planned ahead for."", """", ""As a whole, The Host provides thrills, emotion, and political overtones in this film about a fish monster killing people and taking them hostage (presumably to eat later). Though imperfect as it does have some iffy pacing at times and the ending feeling a little fortunate, The Host is still an incredibly tight and thrilling experience offered by Bong Joon-ho. Somehow, this is only my second film from him (Snowpiercer being the other). Clearly, I need to see more, even if Snowpiercer was just okay."" ]";5

Throughout, laughs are provided as you watch the absurdity of the situations that Josh Baskin finds himself in and that is coupled with a touching story that we can all relate to as we age (though not quite as rapidly, haha). The film is admittedly a little cheesy at times, but it never really bothered me honestly. In the lead role, Tom Hanks is killer and plays the grown up overnight role perfectly and really embodies the little \""ticks\"" you would expect from somebody who underwent the transformation he underwent.

For all of them, they got to play very well developed and multi-faceted characters, a bonus for them and a key element to what makes this one a success, as the script is very well done. In addition, the love story is well done. I am not typically overly into romantic films, but this one is definitely different as the romance feels real and not cheesy at all. All of these elements also feel realistic for the time period depicted and really makes it feel like an authentic portrayal of a man and a wife who are going through troubled times with one another. Finally, the film is very interesting, it never really failed to have my interest. Yes, it is slow and methodic, but it is a gorgeous film to watch and take in and never really heads towards \""boring\"" for me.

The characters are all really well done, but above all, the film is a ton of fun. As with all Edgar Wright films, they are well made and well written, so they meet those requirements for a good film and then they are entertaining, so you get to watch something that is really well put together and is fun to watch. A win-win, really. The action is as over the top as it should be in this one, as it is intended to be comedic and boy is it ever. The comedy is sometimes quite overt and sometimes a bit more subtle, which I really enjoy, as it adds a sharpness and wittiness that many comedy films ignore.

A story of both following your dreams to the fullest and that your surroundings and who you are do not define, but rather what you do with them, Ratatouille is entirely moving.

1229;deja-vu;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The problem with many Tony Scott films is that, in spite of his impeccable style, they are just hollow and cliche action films. Though repainted with a nice, new glossy sheen, the wall still has the same cracks and faults in spite of its new coat of paint. Deja Vu is another entry in his filmography that suffers from this. Though featuring Scott's highly frenetic style of shooting action with rapid cuts and imagery that looks obscured by the sun with the brightness jacked way up, the film is  undeniably stylish, but is often derailed by cliches, pure insanity, and a derivative ending where Scott takes the safe way out after creating such a compelling film beforehand. That said, where this film excels is when it treads off the beaten path. Taking a truly inspired approach to the concept of deja vu, the film is often quite smart, innovative, and a truly unique watch. It is a shame, however, to have to accept those strokes of originality while also having to accept the film's banal predictability and over-reliance on action cliches."", ""This originality comes in how Scott indulges in his fascination with surveillance. Previously deeply explored in his 1998 film Enemy of the State, the theme returns in Deja Vu when a bomb explodes on a ship, killing 543 people. ATF agent Douglas Carlin (Denzel Washington) is brought onto the case due to his sharp eye and ability to quickly identify what needs to be looked into further. Quickly, he figures out the key to the case is the death of a woman named Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton). Joining the team of FBI agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), Carlin is made privy of a special surveillance tool. Allowing the agents to look into the past on an alternate plane of time, the agents watch Claire in her home and try to find when her path crosses with the terrorist. Unfortunately, they can only look four and half days into the past from any given point. Attempts to try and change the future and capture the terrorist before he bombs the boat can certainly be made, but is it possible to avoid destiny?"", ""A major theme in the film is undoubtedly destiny and how we change our own. If a person is destined to do something, is it at all possible to be able to change it? Coming out a year after Hurricane Katrina destroyed New Orleans, this Bayou-set thriller certainly plays on how people tried to explain that natural disaster. The hurricane rings a chord throughout the film with people explaining how the bombing is different because it was not a natural disaster. The terrorist has a home in the 9th ward, one of the most brutally destroyed areas of the city. This concept of destiny and \""God's will\"" as an explanation for the bombing could also be chosen to explain why the hurricane happened. Showing how somethings are simply ordained and unavoidable no matter what happens, Deja Vu is a deep believer is destiny until it comes time for Denzel to save the day. Yet, until then, its exploration of destiny and how fruitless it is to change small events along the way in the hope that it will change things at the end, is quite inspired. With each scenario and alteration adding up with throwaway plot points from the beginning that shows the deja vu inherent in the whole film, the film is incredibly tightly written, but also quite engaging. In essence, ignoring the ending, the film is about how even if we know something is coming, it is best to just brace for impact because something's cannot be run from, no matter where we bolt."", ""It is this ending that ruins not only the themes, but the sheer insanity of the film. Though it escapes the realm of reality with this infusion of science fiction, Deja Vu's stylish cinematography and glossy plot nearly lift it over the hurdles. However, once they zone in on the terrorist and shootouts and explosions ensue, Deja Vu becomes quite pedestrian. It is obvious Denzel will just come in and save the day in spite of the film telling the audience until then that a person cannot go back in time and cannot change destiny. It is a shame to see Scott indulge the more basic action cliches, a trait he often does embrace, in this otherwise finely tuned and impeccably smart thriller that may be implausible with gaping plotholes, but is otherwise entertaining and greatly unique."", ""With a strong central performance from Denzel Washington, Deja Vu is another stylish collaboration between he and the tragically late Tony Scott. In spite of a unique build-up, some time travel, and unexpected science fiction, Deja Vu is a surveillance thriller that explores destiny courtesy of Scott's fast paced style. With quick cuts and a sun-drenched camera, the film looks similar to Michael Bay's Bad Boys or Scott's earlier film Man on Fire. Though an improvement on the latter, Deja Vu still ends too predictably to rise completely over mediocrity and settles into being nothing more than an above average film."" ]";5

Nolan is really on the top of his game here. Bale and Jackman were also great leads and while they were not in a ton of scenes together, they were undoubtedly dominated the screen. Another major plus was the costume design and the sets. As a period piece, they did a great job establishing the feel of the era. I also liked the undercurrent of rivalry in everything in the film.

The cinematography is also brilliant, especially the big aerial shots flying over the countryside that are breathtakingly well executed. Helen Mirren is very, very good here in this stoic and reserved role as Queen Elizabeth. Michael Sheen is also very good as Tony Blair. In terms of story, The Queen falters a tad. Though it is well told, it does drag in spots and really never becomes truly engaging. Fortunately, it does a great job creating sympathy for the Queen, even if we think sh is wrong. Instead, we understand her and come to understand her even more as the film progresses. Though, as I said, the film does slack a bit in the middle and can be a bit stiff. On the whole, The Queen is a brilliantly executed film in production and technical elements, but its plot is not nearly as solid."" ]";5

Though it can be historically inaccurate and disrespectful towards the Mayans at times, it does paint a sympathetic portrait of some factions of the civilization, including that which our hero belongs. The film really paints a mysterious picture of the current events plus those to follow, with there being a significant swell of unease amongst the people in the film as they are unsure of what their future will hold. Additionally, the film has incredible mise en scene with great use of lighting and, similar to Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, a film that can be told through the eyes and the visuals. The subtitles are needed, but not required in this relatable table of survival and fear. The costumes and make-up are fantastic, as is the camera work and production design. Gibson really ensures that the beauty of this scenic location is brought to life against this backdrop of sheer horror. Gibson does a great job keeping a hold of this film from going off the rails with the complex situations of the society and with the excessive violence.

While I think it could have been less compiicated, I am more content with the way it is currently. It is hard for me to understand the criticism aimed at this one.

Well-written and well-directed, Half Nelson does a great job creating multidimensional characters that help to bring their stories to life. With good pacing, it really keeps your attention as you watch these two fall down the rabbit hole into more and more trouble. Plus, I really like the ending. Will they change? Will they stay the same? It is up to you based on what you know of these characters and I enjoyed that ambiguity. Overall, Half Nelson is an engaging and realistic film of addiction in the inner city."" ]";5
1237;blood-diamond;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""I am surprised to not see this one get more praise from the critics. Yes, Leonardo DiCaprio was fantastic and Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly also turned in great performances, but this film was great beyond that. The depiction of the horrors inflicted on the people of Sierra Leone (and, really, Africans everywhere) through civil wars and the harvesting of diamonds is brutal to watch, but very well done all the same. In addition, the brutality of the diamond companies is not forgotten either as they are shown to be just as evil as those actually doing the killings in these countries. However, what this one does really well is that even as a social issue film, it never feels preachy. It tells you its points, but it does so in a way that is obnoxious or annoying, which can be an issue with films of this type. Ultimately, this one deserves the praise it gets from regular old viewers, but the critics were a tad too harsh here for my taste. Yes, it is imperfect at times and the violence can be a bit much and numbing, but the story is necessary, moving, and very well put together, even if some issues are indeed present."" ]";5
1238;marie-antoinette;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A tale of decadence and elegance, Marie Antoinette is not your run-of-the-mill biopic period film. Instead, director Sofia Coppola opts to show how to properly light up the night in 18th century France. Complementing the constant party and gossip is modern pop rock that infuses the film with a modern take that matches the extravagant unconventionality of Marie Antoinette. Right down to this music, this film is about the life of Marie Antoinette. Guillotined as part of the French Revolution, Coppola's film ends before this and includes no addendum at the end of the film revealing the fate of its characters. While the film itself is hardly historically accurate, this move is deliberate and underscores what Coppola's film is about: her life, not Marie Antoinette's death or reality. She merely takes moments of her life, exaggerates them, or creates them in order to paint a picture of who Marie Antoinette was, both the good and the bad."", ""Decried by French critics for not criticizing Marie Antoinette's (Kirsten Dunst) life of luxury, it only feels fair that the film does not do this. Criticized endlessly in her life for her expensive taste, inability to consummate her marriage (not her fault), and being an Austrian in France, it is about time somebody not overtly criticize the woman. Whether she was nice or not, she certainly had her positive elements and, in the film, was dedicated to her people and her children. She never acted within hostility towards others and did not partake in the catty gossip that permeated the palace. Now, of course, the film does show her decadence, vapidness, and affair, which cast a shadow on her. While it does not chastise these actions, their inclusion shows that the film is fair and balanced when it comes to its main character."", ""Of course, the film is not completely fair when it comes to the people of France. But, honestly, who cares? Marie Antoinette is a film about flair and party. Sofia Coppola embraces this by ignoring history and focusing upon the style of the film and the lavish costume design. Decked head to toe in diamonds, this is a film about excess. Described as a satire or a comedy, the film embraces this with its tongue placed firmly along its cheek when critiquing palace life throughout. For example, a scene where Kirsten Dunst stands naked awaiting somebody to dress her, but she must be dressed by the highest ranking person in the room. Unfortunately, this keeps changing as more and more people walk into the room. Incredibly comical, this scene underscores the comedic tone of the film, which is subtle but ever present. At all times, Coppola eschews the serious tone of many historical films in favor of a light take on a serious subject. Often times, this will fail, but it somehow finds a way to work in this film. Thus, by embracing the decadence of the royal family, Coppola finds absurdity through the parallel created by their extravagance and the poverty of the French people and the debt situation."", ""Visually, Marie Antoinette is stunning. With breathtaking cinematography that made me physically angry with how beautiful it was, the film's visuals are tremendous. Repeated shots of the stairs leading up to the palace, long shots from and of the palace, and shots of men riding horses from a distance, this film is incredibly gorgeous. Of course, what helps this is the lavish color scheme. Blending a variety of colors, the colors in the film are largely introduced by the costumes. With elegantly crafted costumes that burst with flair and color, Marie Antoinette is a gorgeously dressed film that visually defines the wealth and power of the French royal family at the time. By the end, when the French people revolt, it is not hard to see how they could find issue with the family's display of wealth."", ""One of the more compelling elements of this film, however, is the gossip. With Marie Antoinette constantly surrounded by the catty gossip of the palace. The impact of this is a claustrophobic environment that shows the shallowness of the courtroom. As she and other women of the court are constantly under examination and inspection with absurd expectations abounding, the film finds even more entertainment. With the gossip feeling oddly modern and akin to a high school clique, this is where Coppola turns the film almost into a historical Mean Girls. Those surrounding Marie Antoinette are more cruel and judgmental towards her and others than the people who eventually would have her beheaded in the revolution. Of course, there is also comedy in these high expectations as the King (Rip Torn) has a mistress and she is forced upon the women of the court. The women are appalled by her and her conduct, even though they themselves have sex and there is a constant obsession with getting Marie Antoinette to consummate her marriage with Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). Coppola does not shy away from showing this absurdity of expectation with Louis being the one afraid to have sex"" ]";5

Scarlett Johansson, Hugh Jackman, and Woody Allen, are great in this crime comedy film that has a smart, well-written script. While the film can be subtly sexist at times, it outweighs this with a truly hysterical script that features perfect comedic delivery from Woody Allen here. If you do not like his comedic style, Scoop will not be the film for you, but I find Woody Allen hysterical and Scoop is no exception. The comedy here is A+ and the mystery/romance element live up to that standard with a solid romance story and a captivating mystery that keeps you guessing from beginning to end as to how it will all turn out. Though many considered Scoop to be one of Woody Allen's misses, I absolutely loved it and found it to be an absolute riot."" ]";5

Meryl Streep is phenomenal and both Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt are very good alongside her. Stanley Tucci is also great in this film. The writing is very strong with each character not being solely good or bad, instead they are real human beings. Multi-dimensional and hard to put in a single box, the characters here act, walk, and talk like real humans, which is very hard to find nowadays. Additionally, the film just works. An interesting look at the inner workings of the fashion industry, a story of entering the workforce, and a story of trying to find the work/life balance, The Devil Wears Prada is very informative on all of those fronts. Even then, it also manages to be romantic and incredibly funny at times. All of these join together to make The Devil Wears Prada quite girly, sure, but also endlessly watchable and enjoyable."" ]";5

Multiple times I was freaking out and scared out of my mind, which is a great thing for a horror film. The creature design was great and the whole story behind it was very compelling. For a film as contained as this one, the tension was always incredibly high and was very well put together. We are really inserted into the mind of the characters and that ups the terror even more.

A suitable conclusion to an incredible career, A Prairie Home Companion blends music and comedy brilliantly, while working in contemplation on death that coincides with the end of a radio variety show. Based on the real life show that is still on the air, A Prairie Home Companion is about a long running weekly variety radio show that is set to be cancelled after the radio station was sold. Starring an ensemble cast, A Prairie Home Companion just feels oddly far too slight to have a lasting impact, but is still a worthy addition to Altman's extensive filmography."", ""Starring Garrison Keillor, Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Lindsay Lohan, Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline, Virginia Madsen, L.Q. Jones, Tim Russell, and Maya Rudolph, the film's greatest asset is its actors. With a star studded cast, the film is blessed with a wealth of terrific performances. As a private investigator who runs security for the show, Kevin Kline appears as Guy Noir. A part of the real life show, Guy Noir is an homage to film noir detectives and Kline knocks the role out of the part. From the great opening with Kline delivering a voice over akin to a 1940s film noir, the film opens with a roar. Accented with noir lighting on a dark night and a raspy delivery from Kline, the film made me realize I desperately need to find a neo-noir film with Kevin Kline. Alongside Kline, Meryl Streep turns in a terrifically great performance as Yolanda Johnson, one half of a singing sister duo. With a great voice and typically adept performance, Streep is a great almost calming presence next to her sister, portrayed by Lily Tomlin. With Tomlin playing a more boisterous sister, Streep's calm demeanor is a great anchor in scenes between the two. Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly are great as a cowboy singing duo with gruff, funny deliveries both on and off stage. The duo are both capable singers and adept comics with good delivery and timing throughout. Garrison Keillor and Lindsay Lohan also turn in great performances here, rounding a tremendous cast."", ""The second strength of this film is the music. Well-written and well performed, the music is a bit more country (hello Nashville) and is balanced between beautiful hymn-like music, straight up country, and comedic songs. Together, they really flow into one another with the actors all more than capable of hitting the right notes on stage. In particular, Streep is phenomenal in all of her songs and finds great chemistry in her duets with Tomlin. Garrison Keillor surprised me with his great voice in singing advertisements for the show, which almost become a running joke throughout with how often they come up. The music is all incredibly composed and really hits a lovely nostalgic note in how it honors the past of the show, the characters' lives, and country music as a whole. This really lends well to the ruminations on death ushered into the film by the angel Asphodal (Virginia Madsen). An angel sent by God to bring people to heaven or bring them simple comforts, Asphodal appears on the set and, though she does bring death, more symbolically stands out as the death of the show. Even as the characters hold out hope for the show to continue, her constant presence shows that this is unlikely to occur. It also forces the characters to face their own morality and come to grips with the fact that the past is the past and can no longer be a part of your present. It is best to let go (finding new jobs, doing eulogies, handing over power of attorney) than it is to hang on for too long and miss your time. The music really captures this note being both nostalgic and somber, but always incredibly pleasant to listen to during the film."", ""Yet, A Prairie Home Companion is oddly slight. Focusing solely on the final show, the film can become a bit tedious and repetitive during its slightly over 90 minute run time. While the characters are fun and engaging, the film is never as fun as it seems it should be. It is almost as if there is an inside joke that the audience is not privy to, which keeps us at an arm's length from the film. This is ultimately the film's biggest hindrance and likely the source of why the film received more mixed reviews from audience members as opposed to critics. It just does not feel as if every piece is there, which hurts the overall product. The ending certainly contributes to this with nothing but a quick voice over from Guy Noir tying the end of the show to the scene at the diner, which is too brief and ill-explained to really work."", ""With great performances, music, and a lush brown hue to the entire proceedings, A Prairie Home Companion is a funny, compelling, and occasionally odd film from Robert Altman. The last film of his career, it feels as though Altman knew it was time and created a film to bring comfort to those who loved his work."" ]";5

Part ballet film and part prison escape film, White Nights concerns a popular ballet dancer, Nikolai Rodchenko (Mikhail Baryshnikov). A defector from the Soviet Union, his life is thrown into turmoil when his plane crashes in Siberia and he suddenly winds up back in his homeland again. Not immediately arrested with the Soviets hoping to have him dance at the opening the ballet season, they pair him up with American defector and tap dancer Raymond Greenwood (Gregory Hines), as well as Raymond's Russian wife Darya (Isabella Rossellini). With KGB agent and Nikolai's handler Colonel Chaiko (Jerzy Skolimowski), the trio plan their escape from the Soviet Union. Occurring during the period when Russia is in constant light (\""white nights\""), there is no place to hide from the KGB, despite public attention Nikolai's presence in his former homeland as a convicted criminal."", ""Heavily focused on the dancing, White Nights often shows too much dancing and not enough plot, especially compared to is lengthy two hour and 16 minute runtime, which is far too long. Though the dancing is tremendous and real life Soviet defector and ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov knows what he is doing, the film needed to decide if it was a ballet film or a drama. If the former, then the ballet sequences make a lot of sense and serve a great purpose in the film. If it is a drama, less ballet and tap dancing should have been on the menu. That said, the dancing sequences that add to the plot are tremendous and filled with tension as they use the dancing to lull Chaiko into believing everything is normal."", ""However, the real highlight of the film comes as they escape from Nikolai's apartment building, narrowly trying to avoid the attention of the KGB. Slipping out the window, the scene is filled with tension and terrifically directed by Taylor Hackford. It is largely silent and perfectly paced. The sequence saves the film from being a relatively average film and perfectly captures the paranoia of escaping these type of regimes. Tying it to an earlier scene, however, it does pack a lot of power. For Nikolai, he says he is still Russian despite previously defecting. But, he is not a Soviet. Providing insight into the position people in the Soviet Union and similar countries find themselves in, the film finds considerable power in this throwaway line for its poignancy and relevance to modern society."", ""That said, the film is flawed. As said, it is a bit unfocused when it comes to the storyline resulting in it being far too long. Long stretches of the film drag significantly and barely move anything along, even the characters. It really does suffer from this, but also from the acting. Led by two professional dancers, the film has some killer dance sequences as a result, but their inexperience really shows. Heck, even the professional actors struggle here with nobody turning anything better than average-to-mediocre performances. Finally, the film's finale is a bit of a let down. Far too optimistic and uplifting for a film that goes to great lengths to describe the horror of the Soviet Union, it misses an ample opportunity to show us that horror, opting instead for a sweet and safe ending. This is certainly a let down for a film that, otherwise, did a great job showing the oppression and its impact on ordinary people."", ""A slow and largely unrewarding first half turns into a compelling and tense second half, only to be let down by a happy ending. Largely quite forgettable, Taylor Hackford's White Nights is a solid film that is entertaining with good, if unnecessary, dancing sequences."" ]";5

Sent to prison for thirty years on a variety of charges, Jackie DiNoscio (Vin Diesel) is given a chance to turn state's witness against his friends in the Lucchese crime family. However, he refuses. What ensues is a nearly two year trial involving Jackie and the rest of the leading members of the Lucchese crime family in New Jersey. Complicating matters is the fact that, not only are all defendants being tried at the same time, but Jackie has opted to act as his own attorney. Funny, terrifically acted, and an engrossing drama in its own right, Find Me Guilty is so ludicrous and absurd that it just has to be true."", ""At the heart of this film's success is the performance of Vin Diesel. Starring as Jackie DiNoscio, Diesel is in pretty much every shot aside from the brief moments shown from the prosecution's discussions about the case. Otherwise, this is Diesel picture. Casual, likable, and magnanimous, Diesel easily sells DiNoscio as a man who can be rooted for without endorsing what he did in his life. We see him as an honest and laid back who is one of the few men caught up in this trial who admits what he has done. There is no hiding that he is a bad man who did a lot of wrong, but DiNoscio is uninterested in hiding that information. Instead, the trial is personal for him as he tries to defend himself (and his friends as a by-product due to the nature of the charges) and examine how some of the people he trusted could betray him by testifying. Wearing his heart on his sleeve, Diesel nails Jackie in the more emotional scenes of cross-examining his cousin and in the more comical moments of him  playing up his charm to the jury. In all, Diesel manages to make this mobster into a man who the audience is comfortable rooting for, which is perhaps the great accomplishment one could give his acting. He is honest, he is raw, and above all, he is intensely real. Diesel shows all sides of this man - his anger, his philandering, his drug use, his drug dealing, and his love of friends and family alike - and makes him into a genuine and, somehow, good hearted person."", ""A lot of this is due to the film's great script that is very natural. Sidney Lumet's films obviously ride on the actors and the natural dialogue given to them with Find Me Guilty being no exception. The film is not one that is ever particularly stagy and the dialogue captures this perfectly. Jokes delivered by Diesel or one-liners rely on his natural charisma in part, but also in the film's dialogue that makes these lines never come off as written. Instead, they include the imperfections, the awkward phrasing, pace, and delivery, of a natural in-the-moment story or joke. In a similar vein, the script manages to balance this ambitious endeavor of showing the lengthiest trial in the history of the federal courts quite nicely. The film never feels crowded or abbreviated. It includes the important moments, the important conversations, and the important characters, without ever allowing the picture be weighted down with too much information. Rather, it shows us what we need to know, shows how it fits in, and then never belabors the point or clutters the rest of the film. It is an unfussy, focused, and stripped back that covers what it needs to without ever dipping into excess. It builds the character of Jackie - both personally and professionally - and it shows the important days of the trial, the crucial conversations, and the relevant cases. It is a film that may be slowly paced and possibly overlong, but it is not filled with much clutter whatsoever, making it one that is hard to argue should have been cut down."", ""What really captures the eccentricity of this film perfectly is often the way in which Lumet opts to capture the action. Typically, courtroom dramas are shot with a heavy array of close-ups or medium shots. While this is occasionally still true in Find Me Guilty, Lumet largely relies upon a handheld camera or extreme high-angle shots to showcase the action in and out of the courtroom. Deep focus in the prison shows Jackie walk into his cell in the distance as other inmates closer to the camera mill about on their own. The same in the courtroom shows defendants as they laugh or fidget in their seats. In the hallway, a handheld camera gets stuck behind a crowd of observers as they all cram into the elevator with the deep focus giving us the belief that we too are stuck behind this massive throng of people. In the car as Jackie is transported over, the handheld camera whips between Jackie and the cops like a person's head would. As Jackie argues his case, Lumet often uses the aforementioned high-angle shot, creating a feeling of the audience being no different than another observer, sitting high up in the rafters of the courtroom. The same is continued in the prosecutors office with Lumet's high-angle shots creating a fly-on-the-wall experience."" ]";5

The acting is superb and this compliment extends to the entire cast, not just Hollywood a-listers Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.

The mother of 10 kids and constantly battling poverty, Evelyn competes in jingle contests.

It is glorious in this fashion as it shows just how horrible the conditions were for women in this era. They are restricted to the home. Men doubt they do anything at all and women themselves downplay what they do and their own intelligence. Meanwhile, when men are left with the kids, they are inept and incapable of relating to ther children, highlighting just how hard a mother's job was back then. Director Jane Anderson does a tremendous job not making the film preachy in this regard and instead shows how these women contribute, celebrating their accomplishments. They may not make the money, but they compete and raise the kids, which are crucial to the health and prosperity of the family.

Watching a baseball game and getting blind with rage, drinking a six-pack daily, and locking the kids out of the house to cry on his own for fear his wife left him, are all moments that are incredibly powerful. Harrelson does a great job portraying this man that is so easy to hate and demonize, but both Evelyn and the director refuse to demonize him. He is a sympathetic character, if you can look past the rough exterior.

It is a testament to women's strength throughout in this regard as Evelyn is a bright star amidst this black sky. Julianne Moore brilliantly portrays this woman who gets absolutely nothing. She works hard and slaves everyday with nothing in return. She passionately wants a few things, but sacrifices day and night for her family. It is powerful and emotional to watch unfold and a struggle that is not lost on her children who bravely fight for her whenever Kelly gets mad. The bond between Evelyn and her children is gorgeously and gracefully portrayed throughout, with this bond being the real highlight of this film. Moore portrays Evelyn with equal grace, strength, and power throughout. Evelyn is a woman that, despite her restraining factors, is an inspirational to everybody for how she gives and gives without any expectation of getting something in return.

Munich, in spite of its sheer entertainment value at times, can slow down to a drag and be a tough watch. When it is humming, it is a brilliant work, but when it slows down, it is merely a dull look at the situation. Fortunately, these moments are infrequent, but noticeable enough over the course of the nearly three hour film to detract from the overall product.

In spite of how tragic the film is at its core, there was enough humor to not bum you out with how Timothy's life ends. On top of this, Herzog's gentle direction really allowed the tapes made by Treadwell to speak for themselves (with a little narration from Herzog) and overall, it leaves you realizing that this man simply loved the grizzly bears and while he may be a little odd, he is oddly endearing and admirable."" ]";5

Honestly, this may be one of the best animated films I have ever encountered. The attention to detail and true visual splendor, is incredible. The final sequence may be one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in a film before. Just...wow. In addition, the music is stellar, but all things created by Danny Elfman have to be, no?

In addition, the set design for 1930s New York/New Jersey is great and feels very authentic. Ultimately, the film is incredibly inspirational, touching, moving, and will have you rooting for Braddock from your couch, even if you know what the end result will be. Thus, in that way, this one reminds you of the magic of film, as even though it may not be the most technically brilliant film or the best one ever, it makes you care and feel something even when you know what is coming next due to the type of film it is. For that, Cinderella Man is a good film that will undoubtedly leave you feeling entertained."" ]";5
1256;ben-hur-1959;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The most expensive film ever made at the time of its release, Ben-Hur has found a lasting legacy as the definitive Biblical epic alongside Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments. Many Christian families gather around at least once a year to watch either one or possibly both. A film of epic proportions, it is easy to see why this film resonates so deeply with both believers and non-believers alike. Telling the story of Jesus Christ's time on Earth before his crucifixion at the hands of the Romans, the film take a far more intimate approach compared similar Biblically-based films. As opposed to even DeMille's epic film or more modern takes on Christ in films such as The Last Temptation of Christ or Passion of the Christ, Ben-Hur tells the story of Jesus through the eyes of others. Aside from a few brief frames, his face is never shown. His sermon on the mount is briefly shown, but is limited to just depicting the crowds gathering around him. Jesus' words are never spoken from his own lips. Rather, it is by word-of-mouth that people hear his words as the gospel is spread throughout the land. This is not a typical Jesus film in that its focus is on a single man, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), his family, and his life. The film's power is not derived from the portrayal of Christ, but the portrayal of how his life impacts everybody around him for the better, with the power to change somebody's entire mindset."", ""A wealthy man living in Judea, Judah's life is thrown into turmoil when his old friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) arrives from Rome. The new tribune in Judea, Messala is tasked with quelling the rising tide of religion that has taken a hold in the land with word of messiah having been born. Seeking help from Judah to stomp out those that wish to use violence to overthrow Roman power in the region, Messala is quickly rebuked by Judah who does not wish to inform on his own people. Now sworn rivals, Messala is able to get the assistance he demanded from Judah when Judah's sister accidentally knocks a shingle off of their home that nearly kills the governor. Making an example out of Judah and his family by imprisoning them and sending Judah off to be a slave, Messala sets off a chain of events that will change everybody's lives forever."", ""Relegated to servitude, Judah is left in the dark as to how his sister and mother are doing while imprisoned. He must slave as a rower, but not before encountering Jesus for the first time. With Jesus' role quite limited in the film in terms of appearances, the few times we do see some of him is immediately noteworthy. This encounter, in which Jesus offers Judah a drink of water, is immediately powerful. Watching the son of God stoop down and clean off a dirty man and give him water to drink is moving and shows the film's ability to create that sense of awe and presence that religious films must have when showing Jesus. As time progresses, Judah finds the favor of Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) after saving his life in battle, earning his freedom and becoming Arrius' adoptive son. Afterwards, he sets out to find his family and, simultaneously, embarks on a mission of revenge to find Messala and make him pay for what he did to his family."", ""This hatred that consumes Judah is really what defines this film. It is something he must overcome, but it is a challenge. In the incredible chariot scene, he finally does get to square off with Messala. However, this is a film that pulls no punches. Judah and Messala do not receive a scene where they say sorry and get that cathartic release. Instead, in true Biblical fashion, Judah must forgive the unforgivable. Due to Messala's actions, Judah's mother Miriam (Martha Scott) and sister Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell), contracted leprosy. How can he be expected to forgive Messala for such a cruel injustice when they did nothing to deserve that treatment? He showed Messala nothing but love, opened his home to him, and gave him a horse. Yet, he gets stabbed in the back. It is this hatred and resentment that spurs Judah to live and not just accept death as a slave. To be free to is to be able to exact his revenge on Messala, an opportunity he refuses to give up on. It is a hatred that invigorates his spirit and gives him the will to go on. However, no matter how passionate it is, this hatred is debilitating. It saps his ability to live and to live well. All-consuming, his hatred for Messala does not die with Messala. Instead, it is Messala's greatest final act of hatred: to make Judah so consumed with hate that he loses sight of God and continues to allow it to dwell in his soul long after Messala is gone. Through his encounters with Christ, however, Judah begins to see the light. Walking away from the sermon on the mount, but running to Christ's aid and giving him water as he carries his cross, Judah begins to feel the power of God. When he sees Jesus dying on the cross, asking for his killers to be forgiven, Judah learns just how misguided he had"" ]";5

Yes, it was slow at times, but everything included was definitely important for the story and having things make sense. Now, in terms of the film, it is gorgeous in many respects. First, the cinematography is great. The sets are also beautifully put together and they really chose a great location for filming this one, as it provided many beautiful images. In addition, the soundtrack was perfect. Often times, I do not notice a film's soundtrack, except when it was very good or very bad, and this one was great. Finally, the battle scenes were very well put together. They were certainly violent, but for the most part, beautifully filmed and choreographed.The acting was also solid, in particular from Edward Norton. He had a very small role, but had a really commanding presence here and killed it whenever he was speaking. Brendan Gleeson and Jeremy Irons were also very good here. Orlando Bloom and Eva Green were mostly good as well. Really, the only things holding this one back for me were the pace at times. While, for the most part, it was very interesting and moved at a steady pace, at times it slowed down to almost a crawl. If those could be picked up a bit, this one would be better. Another negative would be the script. At times, it was absolutely cringeworthy, at others it was serviceable, and at others it was pretty good.

Entirely sombering and one of the most emotionally distressing films I have ever seen. I honestly feel as though I may have PTSD after watching this one, it was just that emotionally powerful and resonant. Many claim that this one is a little slow and overlong, but I never saw that honestly. One of the main points of criticism is the wedding sequence, but if you cannot tell that the joy and happiness in that sequence is meant to directly juxtapose the sadness and emotional turmoil of the rest of the film, I am honestly sad for you, because that is one of the most brilliant pieces of this one. An entirely beautiful sequence, I could honestly watch the wedding for the entire three hours, because at least I would not leave this one feeling emotionally defeated. The Russian Roulette elements, and the characters' transformations from the first one to the final one, are immaculately filmed and just so impactful throughout. The direction from Michael Cimino is truly remarkable, as is the acting from the two true stars here; Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep. Walken steals the show throughout, but Streep's emotionally vulnerable performance (especially considering what was happening in her personal life with John Cazale at the time) is heartbreakingly beautiful and stands tall as one of the best performances in a film littered with them. Finally, the final half hour is pitch perfect filmmaking and, while entirely distressing, just so mesmerizingly perfect you cannot look away. However, in spite of all this, it is a touch long and in terms of war films, I do think Downfall and Saving Private Ryan are superior, though I would rank this one over other Vietnam films such as Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. As a whole, The Deer Hunter is not for everyone, but I can entirely see why it is a classic and, to me, it deserves to be 100%."" ]";5
1259;layer-cake;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A sleek, stylish, and gritty gangster crime thriller from director Matthew Vaughn, Layer Cake is a pretty damn good film. In a truly charismatic turn, Daniel Craig stars as the nameless protagonist. Looking to get out of the drug business, our hero gets caught between stolen Serbian drugs and the search for a girl strung out on drugs and hanging with bad company. A pretty straight forward crime film, Layer Cake is flawed and a bit messy at times, but has terrific kinetic energy that keeps it going. Layer Cake may not convince me Matthew Vaughn is a very good director (Kingsman can die in a fire), but it is another surprisingly good entry in his filmography."", ""Starring Craig as XXXX, the unnamed gangster, the film's biggest fault is its plot lacks resolution. He is hired to find this girl and the film forgets about her. He begins to have sex with Sienna Miller, but gets pulled out of the room and then it jumps to him leaving a country club with her at the end. Many of the film's plot elements are just skimmed through, names get jumbled up, or events and people are simply forgotten. Vaughn tries to string these together quite loosely and it only slightly works out at times. Fortunately, its energy and action allow you to forget about the plot a bit, but it hurts because then there is very little meat on the film's bones. The characters, regardless of sex, are useless. This is one of the film's biggest problems. While its style is nice, the same cannot be said for a pretty run-of-the-mill script that feels like a rehash of Snatch or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. The fact that Vaughn was a producer on those films is hardly a surprise considering how similar the style is between this film and those Guy Ritchie films. That said, the poor characterization and lack of plot cohesiveness is hardly too detrimental, it just prevents the film from being better."", ""What is quite detrimental for Layer Cake is its shaky cam. I hate shaky cam. Using shaky cam through a lot of the action scenes, it was annoying and disorienting. Shaky cam is used in one of the most climactic portions of the film and it is a real buzzkill, leaving the sequence with no tension and, in its place, annoyance and a headache. That said, it is an exception as most of the film does not rely on shaky cam, thankfully. Unfortunately, it only makes that one sequence all the more jarring and horrible to watch, as the film has hardly prepared the viewer to take it all in via shaky cam."", ""That said, the film's plot is quite tense and thrilling at times. Even if its characters lack definition, they are quite engaging to watch and provide interest in the film. The complex and always changing plot is more than engaging and leaves the audience guessing throughout. While hardly original, there are enough moving parts that keep you distracted and focused on the intrigue and more engaging bits of the plot, namely the impending arrival of the Serbian mafia threatening XXXX's life. While diversions into his love life are unwelcome and the film can outdo itself at time, the plot - for a run-of-the-mill gangster action thriller - is hardly anything I can complain about."", ""All in all, Layer Cake is a fine film. It is unoffensive and palatable. Well-directed and incredibly stylish, it has its flaws, but it is a largely fun experience that simply lacks any mean or substance. For action junkies or people who like films of this kind, it will more than quench your thirst. For those who like some more meat on their films, Layer Cake may leave you quite cool and under the mistaken belief that there had to be more to this film than was shown. Fortunately, even for the latter group, the cool and charismatic Daniel Craig more than saves the film and helps to contribute to a film, while disposable, is more than entertaining and is great popcorn entertainment."" ]";5

Heartwarming and built around family with childlike wonder, the film also shows Spielberg's great ability to create thrills and scares along the way. Tom Cruise is great in the lead role and really does a great job as the deadbeat dad tasked with saving his kids who do not really like him too much. Dakota Fanning does very well as his daughter, though she does become annoying a few times. The special effects and creature design are incredible, while also demonstrating why everybody is so paranoid. The film also does a great job drawing parallels with historical occupations (French in Algeria, Britain in the United States), while capturing the paranoia of post-9/11 America all in one swoop. Overall, War of the Worlds is a fantastic science fiction film that really is a testament to Spielberg's skill in the director's chair."" ]";5

However, when the Spear of Destiny is discovered in Mexico, it sets into motion a series of events that sees the son of Lucifer, Mammon, be summoned back to Earth. The only thing standing in the way of Mammon and any other half-breed demons that seek to try and possess humans is John Constantine (Keanu Reeves). A demon slayer armed with crucifixes, a gold-plated gun in the shape of a cross, and copious amounts of holy water, Constantine is an impure soul. With a soul long ago claimed by Lucifer (Peter Stormare) for his suicide attempt as a young boy, he consistently seeks retribution by deporting demons back to hell in the name of God. With a soul in hell and a spirit in heaven, Constantine is the perfect man to enforce the balance between heaven and hell on Earth that demons consistently test."", ""Found by Angie (Rachel Weisz) after the suicide of her psychic twin sister, Constantine is tasked with restoring the balance between good and evil no matter the costs to himself or others. In waging this holy war against those that wish to sink humanity into the pits of hell, Constantine naturally hopes to seek favor from God in order to make amends for his mortal sin. Yet, in learning from the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) that he is damned and will remain damned, Constantine continues his spiral of self-destruction. Killing himself by smoking cigarettes that have led to terminal lung cancer, Constantine is the quintessential noir protagonist. Cynical, chain smoking, and cooly charismatic, Reeves both damns the world around him in his language, is deeply jaded, and knows how to deliver random bursts of wit with the requisite zip to make the dialogue pop and feel natural. He is the perfect man for this role with the natural charisma to make him appealing, but the dour demeanor that makes his overwhelming cynicism come off authentically."", ""Yet, it is Peter Stormare who steals the show in this film. Appearing for a brief moment towards the end as Lucifer, Stormare's menacing, sadistic, and devilishly terrifying turn as the very embodiment of evil is the highlight of this film. However, it largely becomes the highlight because of Francis Lawrence's smart and strong direction up to that point. While he allows Stormare's Lucifer to command the screen at the end, until the climax we never actually see him. Instead, his presence is allowed to be felt and linger in the actions of the demons and wicked in the world, creating an omnipresent darkness that descends upon the screen throughout the film. By the time we see him, Stormare is practically set up to disappoint with how ominous the film feels in anticipation of seeing Lucifer for the first time. Yet, through his true embodiment of the fallen angel, Stormare is a sinister and truly demonic presence that chews up the scenery and more than lives up to the hype."", ""As a sinner battling for his own soul, Constantine's battle with Lucifer and the demons of the world is most certainly spiritually significant for anybody watching the film. Paralleling and bringing to life the very real battle waged daily by every person alive to ensure that their soul goes to heaven, the film brings to life the demons that stalk the world and sinister dark arts that surround us all. Waging war through religion, putting himself on the line for others, and leaning on the power of God for extra strength are all actions undertaken by John Constantine as he does battle with Mammon, the sinister Gabriel, and Lucifer. By turning to God and using both His word and His promise to humanity as his source of strength, Constantine is able to overcome all evil he encounters, even if it is the natural evil that resides within himself and urges him to sin. He is able to stamp down this temptation and put God first in his heart and mind. Yet, his struggle until the climax highlights the struggle we all face. Being righteous seeking reward through a spot in God's home is not righteous. It is hollow righteous in the name of self-gratification. It is only when he sacrifices himself and opens up his soul to be finally claimed by Lucifer to save another person from hell does he actually receive the forgiveness he had fought for all these years. Through selfless and second nature self-sacrifice, he is able to receive the absolution he has long fought for, but not until then."" ]";5

Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen, were all great and really worked well together comedically. The writing and direction from Judd Apatow were both very good.

I got what they were trying to do, but the beginning sequence of Oh Dae-su being very drunk and then winding up in this prison for 15 years was horrifically executed. It was incoherent and made no sense while watching it. I obviously figured out that was what happened at some point, but the film made no attempt to make it a coherent transition. Instead, it showed a drunk guy and then a guy locked up asking why he is being held with very little connection."", """", ""Additionally, the biggest complaint is the end. Oh Dae-su is held for 15 years because he saw Lee Joo-win have sex with his sister and then he told his friend who spread the news around the school. The sister killed herself as a result (oh wait, excuse me, she was dropped). That is why this happened. Even worse, Chan-wook Park then decided it would be fun if the film became absolute nonsense by having Oh Dae-su have sex with Mi-do who is his daughter. Brilliant twist really. How did he wind up doing this, you ask? Oh well Lee Joo-win, in his endless quest to get payback for his dead sister, had a woman hypnotize the two of them to put them in situations where they will fall in love. This is not a problem with coherence. I understood it. However, these explanations were less than satisfying. I was already torn on whether or not the overall tone and feel were up my alley, but the ending convinced me that Oldboy was simply not my thing.

The film was also really well written for a comedy and the jokes were, largely, smart instead of low brow, which I greatly appreciated. The main sin committed by this one is the classic love story element here where an unexpected guy manages to land the gorgeous girl that is way out of his league.

1277;the-phantom-of-the-opera;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A film with the music and lyrics provided by Andrew Lloyd Webber could hardly go wrong and Joel Schumacher's The Phantom of the Opera certainly does not take many missteps. While his sense of spectacle can be a bit too flamboyantly gaudy at times, it is hard to deny the visual stimuli on display that Schumacher presents, opting for a bombastic musical akin to Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge!. With raucous crowds, gorgeous production design, and extravagant costume design, The Phantom of the Opera is a lively and inspired musical with excellent performances, solid direction, and phenomenal music that always manages to lift the film up if it ever slacks off. Putting this all into one finished product results in a good musical that is tragic, beautiful, and infused with excellent style."", ""Opening with a black-and-white sequence set in 1919 Paris, the film shows an auction taking place with memorabilia from the opera house being sold. One such item is the infamous chandelier from the night of the disaster, which is sold as item #666. As it is lifted up to be demonstrated, the film beautifully transitions to color with every inch of the frame being absorbed by vibrant golds and reds as the opera house is brought back to glorious life. An inspirational moment from Schumacher to open the film, it may be the creative peak of the film on his part, but it is an undeniably high one and sets the tone from the very beginning: this is a spectacle. The scene immediately following features the first song as delivered by Minnie Driver's Carlotta Giudicelli, who is the prima donna and diva of the opera. Living up to those titles, she is self-absorbed and unafraid to demonstrate how in love with herself she is at every turn. In this opening number, the sensually extravagant choreography and vibrant use of color provide the film with a fittingly loud and wondrous opener. With a lot of visual conflict, Schumacher plays all the right notes from the very beginning of this film creating beautiful chaos in the film's presentation and sea of color. Accompanying this opening number is an introduction to Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum). A beautiful, but unknown, dancer, Christine was raised in the opera house and has been taught to sing by the mysterious Phantom of the Opera (Gerard Butler). Ogled by the male gaze of the camera and of the opera houses new owners, Christine's peril is forcefully thrust into focus as we see her introduced as a talented girl, but one at the behest of dangerous men around every corner. With the Phantom trying to possess her and keep her for his own pleasure as a wife, Christine has her back against the wall. The men of the opera house still do view Carlotta as their lottery ticket, but are certainly taken by Christine's beauty. Meanwhile, the Phantom orchestrates productions to ensure she is the lead singer and tries to keep other men such as Raoul (Patrick Wilson) out of her life. She is a woman left with very little choice as to where to go and what to do in order to live the life she desires. In essence, she continuously finds herself being past the \""point of no return\"" as a result of letting the mysterious Phantom into her life."", ""Her only savior is Raoul. Reigniting a romance with Raoul over the course of the film, the film finds great fire and passion in their love throughout, but the writing certainly does it a disservice at times. The dialogue can be awkwardly presented, especially whenever Raoul comes to save Christine from her lovesick and deeply obsessed Phantom admirer. Fortunately, the music greatly elevates their love scenes with the duets between Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson being extraordinary. With snow falling on the roof of the opera as the two serenade one another with \""All I Ask of You\"", Schumacher finds similar glamour in this small, intimate moment. The two's vivacious and impassioned performances creates beautiful harmony that ensures the performance is the best one in the film. The two play off of one another beautifully and both deliver pitch perfect notes. In staging the scene, Schumacher also finds an opportunity to further demonstrate the Phantom's looming presence. Hiding behind a statue and watching the couple sing and dance, the camera often racks focus between the couple and the voyeuristic Phantom. Highlighting the joy of Christine when in the arms of Raoul and the loneliness and isolation experienced by the Phantom, the scene is not just beautifully sung and written, but also terrifically staged and framed."", ""With the death of Christine's father being the event that brought her together with the Phantom as a child, it is only natural that one of the best moments of the film comes with Christine visiting her father's tomb in the cemetery. A gray and blue sequence with mist rising off of the ground as Christine walks to the tomb and sings \""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\"", the song is beautifully sung by Rossum."" ]";5

The film is certainly slow at points, but for me, throughout, I was very intrigued by the film. From when they were preparing to when things start going wrong to the end, I was hooked. The film is never great, so to speak, but it was still very good and, while it needed no help in doing so, did a great job creating suspense when things went wrong, as well as sympathy for the families of the men aboard. The suspense is constant and really leaves you on the edge of your seat as you see the inner workings of the ordeal and it almost leaves you in tears as you watch their families deal with the ordeal back at home.

Packed to the brim with magic, imagination, fun, and a childlike wonder, this film inspires hope and belief, all while tearing you down emotionally. I know it may not be as historically accurate as some would hope, but this is what a biopic should be. It covers the relevant topics and still touches you in a way only fiction can, a truly challenging task for most biopics. Johnny Depp is fantastic here, as are  Kate Winslet and all of the young Davies boys. The film's magic and sense of wonder it inspires never really ceases, but certainly extends to the overall message of the film that captures the essence of Peter Pan as well; just believe. The film's cinematography is great, especially the final sequence with Sylvia and the score is also very well done. Finally, the plays within a film that get put on throughout the film are fantastic and brilliantly done, capturing that same imagination and suspension of reality. Finding Neverland is a truly wondrous work."" ]";5

1281;closer;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""There is something about Closer than is entirely off-putting. It is not the fact that it is a film about four people that are, well, unsavory characters. I can handle films about people I do not care for. The problem with Closer is it feels like a 2000s drama that is soulless. I have seen this a few times before (The Reader by Stephen Daldry comes to mind immediately) and there was something about this film that made me feel as though it would not be my cup of tea. This was ultimately the case, even though I did keep an open mind while watching this film. The experience, however, is just far too hollow and director Mike Nichols' cynical look at love just feels surface deep. We all get that love is challenging and messy, but Closer is mostly unengaging and just seems to float by and offer obvious insight into the messy nature of love. That said, there are positives to Closer. As always, it is marvelously well-written for the most part and the acting is terrific. In particular, Natalie Portman steals the show, though Clive Owen turns in a good performance as well."", ""Showing the romantic lives of Anna (Julia Roberts), Daniel (Jude Law), Alice (Natalie Portman), and Larry (Clive Owen), the film shows the four characters swapping dates pretty consistently. Alice and Daniel sleep together. Daniel and Anna sleep together. Anna and Larry sleep together. Larry and Alice sleep together. Everybody is sleeping with each other in this film. Complementing these scenes are the people finding out their significant other slept with somebody else. Everybody cheats here and the film does have a lot to say about infidelity. For Nichols, infidelity is clearly a common act, but one that needs to be admitted to immediately. Though common, it is still disgusting, but only if you do not admit to it immediately. Case in point, Larry cheats on Anna with a hooker but tells her immediately. Meanwhile, Anna is heavily criticized for sleeping with Daniel for over a year, but never telling Larry until he brought up his infidelity. Moral of the story: cheat on your significant other, but be upfront about it and things will be alright. This is a constant thread as the people consistently want confirmation that their significant others slept with somebody else and then only get mad when they do not admit to it immediately. Other than this, Closer offers insight into how sex can be used as a weapon to hurt others, people's insatiable desire to cheat on their significant other, and how love hurts and can never be enough to keep somebody. Insightful stuff."", ""Closer is also plagued by its timeline. Jumping forward by years upon years at the drop of a hat, Closer lost me more than once in its timeline. All of a sudden, Daniel and Alice had just met and then, immediately afterward, it was a year later. This is where a large portion of the soullessness I mentioned previously derives from. This desire to speed things along comes at the expense of developing a connection between us and the characters. Yes, there is a lot revealed in the scenes shown, but the process of them falling in and out of love would be a lot more emotional and rewarding if we got to see more than just a highlight reel of their relationship."", ""This said, Closer has great dialogue. I may mock its relationship insights, but it is hard to deny that its relationships are well created in the moments we are given with them. Here, they can be powerful at times, in particular when Alice and Daniel embrace after he admits to cheating on her with Anna. This scene is very emotional and highlights the tremendous performance by Portman. Throughout, she steals the show and really puts in an emotionally raw performance. No matter the scene, she is the highlight of this film. Similarly, Owen - as a scorned lover and pervert - is brilliant. He has a natural charisma and it really shows here as he able to play such a chilly character with a cool, laid back demeanor throughout. However, he is equally adept at turning it up a notch, such as when he confronts Julia Roberts' Anna about her infidelity. An intense scene, Owen wins the scene by capturing both the anger and the pain that Larry feels in this moment as he presses her for intimate details about Anna and Daniel."", ""Though disappointing, Closer affords a great opportunity to watch great actors do their thing. Other than a few scenes that were noted above though, Closer lacks the emotion and insight needed to actually pull off a film of this type. None of its takes are revolutionary and instead feel entirely derivative and cliche takes on love, rather than an examination into the lives of these characters."" ]";5
1282;red-eye;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""If you ask someone what the most typical thriller movie ever made is, Red Eye should certainly be in contention. Fortunately, a requisite to be the most typical thriller ever made is that the film must be thrilling. Red Eye is certainly that. Director Wes Craven knows how to elicit fears and thrills along the way in this straight forward thriller. The acting is spotty, though never outright bad. The first half of the film is very cheesy and kind of silly, while the second half really finds its groove and, though kind of outlandish, is truly thrilling. This obviously makes the second half far superior, even if the dialogue can be in-and-out between solid and terrible. Essentially what I am trying to communicate here is simple: only thriller fans need apply. Red Eye's typical nature and adherence to cliches will annoy many, but for fans of the genre, its taut thrills and tight plot will be more than satisfactory."" ]";5
1283;broken-flowers;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""This one is slow and I can get why the audience is a little mixed on it, but the critics hit this one right on. Bill Murray is excellent in this one, as is Jeffrey Wright in a supporting role. A tale about a man going on a journey to discover if he has a son and if so, which woman is the mother of that child, this one is simply a slice of life type of film. Nothing extraordinary happens and it is debatable as to if anything happened at all. However, I really do enjoy these type of films for the insight they provide for the characters presented. In Broken Flowers, you really get to really understand Murray's character and his problems and really, you feel bad for him since he is so alone, though he has always been surrounded by people. In addition, Jim Jarmusch's direction is brilliant. He really manages to capture the beauty of life by emphasizing the beauty of the landscape that Murray transverses. Much like life, the beauty is in the details and this film really underscores that. A subtle film that is so subtle it will not really touch a lot of viewers, this one really was moving. On top of that, the comedic moments were well done and actually really funny, but you had to pay attention to catch them. As a whole, Broken Flowers is a very good film that works on multiple levels."" ]";5
1284;hotel-rwanda;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Incredibly impactful and powerful, Hotel Rwanda is a brilliantly crafted film that really hits the viewer quite hard thanks to great writing, storytelling, and a phenomenal performance from Don Cheadle. Without Cheadle's performance, the film would still be very good, but his performance elevates it into the stratosphere of \""great\"" films. The film, at every turn, leaves you on the brink of tears with its power as it pulls the back the cover on the Rwandan genocide. At no point did Rwanda receive the level of help they needed from the Western world, which is truly tragic and is touched on repeatedly throughout the film. An absolute indictment of the West and those who let this atrocity happen, Hotel Rwanda is just the Rwandan Schindler's List. It is far more than that and, honestly, may be just as good or better than that film. Cheadle is phenomenal and he truly commands the screen in Terry George's breathtaking and important film."" ]";5
1285;the-weather-man;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The Weather Man is a decidedly average film, but does present many strengths. Hyper realistic with great and relatable characters, the film really hits home quite often. Nicolas Cage, Hope Davis, and Michael Caine, are all great in their respective roles and, much like the film itself, bring a human quality to their characters. The writing is also very good and the direction from Gore Verbinski is solid, all winding up with a top-notch character study. However, what truly hurts this one, is the main character. Though realistic and relatable, he is entirely too easy to hate to the point that when things go well for him, we do not care. When things go poorly, we feel he deserves it. This may be the point, but it makes it tough to enjoy a film when you hate the protagonist. Honestly, serial killer and mob movies have more likable people as the protagonists than this one. Despite this, as I said, The Weather Man is decidedly average on a wholistic level, but does bring a lot of quality to the table and was quite an easy watch and never drifted into boredom territory, in large part thanks to its honest and realistic approach to its characters."" ]";5

Everybody knows about The Notebook and a review will hardly convince you to change your stance. Personally, it was just fine. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams lack chemistry whatsoever and their section is entirely typical. However, the old people are tremendous and provide all of the spark this film needs and it is a shame that it focuses on the wrong story for much of the runtime. That said, Gosling and McAdams do turn in good performances, even if their part lacks fire or punch. Instead, it rides on cliches and turns in a bland romance billed as epic."", ""I love romance films. I honestly do like chick flicks too. Not in a guilty pleasure way either. I simply like good cinema. The genre does not matter. The target demographic does not matter. Thus, my mixed feelings towards The Notebook are not as a result of being a guy and not liking romance movies. Rather, it is how lazy the section with young Noah Calhoun (Gosling) and Allie Hamilton (McAdams) is and how much it could have been. Often, romance movies opt to have their couples \""meet cute\"". The Notebook takes a unique approach and instead just as Noah awkwardkly threaten to kill himself if Allie did not go on a date with him and creepily stalk her around both a carnival and in the town. How charming. Like, I know it is Ryan Gosling, but this girl should be calling the cops before he sends her his ear as a gift. Oddly though, they are well-matched for one another. Both possessing a propensity for cheating on their significant others when apart, Allie is also incredibly flawed. Slapping Noah during fights, spazzing out randomly, falling apart emotionally regularly, and indecisive, Allie is hardly a catch herself. Like, I know it is Rachel McAdams, but this guy should probably be moving along. Fortunately, he is a creep and she is an oddly abusive and emotional drama queen. It is like a beautiful match made in heaven. In a nutshell, this film is, \""If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best.\"""", ""Fortunately, the section with the older version of the couple is breathtakingly emotional and tender. Love defined, this portion of the film is stunning. Starring James Garner as the older Noah and Gena Rowlands as the older Allie, the couple has incredible chemistry. Noah is now quite frail and had suffered multiple heart attacks in recent times. Allie has dementia and cannot remember Noah or their family. Yet, Noah does not give up and continues to read their story to her in order to help her remember him. The fleeting moments where she does are stunning. Chills, tears, and love, follow whenever they can hold each other and both know that they love one another. These moments are quickly followed up by Allie again forgetting and are powerful, emphasized by the tears in Noah's eyes as Allie gets covered in the fog once again. The ending may be a bit manipulative, but damn if it is not incredibly well-written and deserving of more screentime."", ""The other major plus here is Allie's mother, Ann Hamilton (Joan Allen). Though the situation her daughter found herself in is repugnant, the scene of Ann and Allie driving through South Carolina for Ann to help her daughter figure out what she wanted is great. Packed with emotion and terrific acting by Allen, this what-if scene of risky love versus safe love is powerful. While I did not identify with Allie's scenario, this moment and the emotional performance by Allen in this scene stand as a real highlight in the film."", ""It is fair to say I did not get what I expected from The Notebook. I figured the Gosling and McAdams portion would deliver the goods. Unfortunately, it was greatly disappointing. Though blessed with lush period detail and some great date scenes (laying in the road to watch the traffic light), this one is largely derailed by cliches and unethical characters. Yet, the portion of the older couple is profound and a thoroughly moving look at dementia, aging, and love through time. It is sad that The Notebook is not remembered for this section, which truly sets it apart from other chick flicks or romance films."" ]";5

On the other, this is not. The story just feels so abbreviated and hastened. The great part about the TV series was that while it was about football, of course, it was about so much more than that. It was about the characters and their daily lives and then how everyone would unite on Friday to play football. In the movie, and this is to my point about the abbreviated nature of the movie, a lot of the characterization was missing and it ultimately felt almost impersonal. Sadly, this is why I could not enjoy this one a ton. Now, it was an ok movie and all, but cerainly not as great as I would have hoped.

Ray is a film packed to the brim with passion and it truly overflows. The music in the film is infectious and fantastically worked into the film and subtle direction from Taylor Hackford really pays off as he allows the music and the actors to really take center stage in this one. Ray also expertly handles balancing Charles' youth, rise to fame, stardom, and struggles, with each carrying the required weight and none of the scenes coming as being filler. Rather, they all presented their own set of positives and really combine to be an entirely moving film. In particular, scenes involving Charles as a boy interacting with his mother got to me the most and were some of the best emotional scenes I have seen in a film in a bit. Overall, Ray is a fantastic biopic that manages to avoid feeling like a generic music biopic by being completely authentic and unwilling to compromise our inside look at Charles' life.

Paul Giammati and Thomas Haden Church are terrific in this wine-obsessed film that uses wine and literature as expertly hidden exposition as to who these two characters are. Truly brilliant writing on the part of Payne brings these men to life, along with all of their hidden motivations and baggage without a series of monologues to accomplish the same thing. As mentioned, however, the film does slack at times and can be slightly off-putting by focusing on some detestable main characters. Due to this, Sideways is held back a bit and not as good as Payne's other works. That said, nobody captures the true essence of his characters like Payne and Sideways is entirely character driven.

The cinematography is also gorgeous as they were able to extract every bit of beauty they could out of their African location. As mentioned, this one is a tad slow, but it never really failed to have my attention. Throughout the film, I was completely hooked as I tried to follow every twist and turn before the big conclusion at the end. The great part about this one is that the second half really does explain much of what we see in the first half. It is a tad confusing, but the answers to any questions we have are ultimately provided and things begin to make a bit more sense. In addition, the film brings a lot of ethical concerns surrounding drug companies and their operations in Africa to the forefront, as you know the plot of this one is not too far-fetched. While the film was very thrilling, it also makes you feel a lot of empathy for those who are exploited in the name of medicine.

Without him, this film would be nothing extraordinary. But, with him, it is elevated significantly. Overall, the story is ok and is somewhat compelling, but every line spoken by Pacino are a mixture of emotions. On the surface, many undeniably funny, but it is also hard-hittingly powerful or inspirational, while many of them are simply depressing, as he is a man who thinks he has no further purpose in life. On top of Pacino, Chris O'Donnell does a great job (as does Philip Seymour Hoffman in a small role RIP), making this even more of an acting showcase, rather than a superb film. However, regardless, the film is incredibly enjoyable and endearing as we learn to love Slade (much like Charlie) and all of his little quirks. Plus, his monologue at the end is absolutely phemomenal and really stands as one of the best monologues in film."", """", ""On the negative side of things, it is a tad long. I love getting to see this much of their lives, but if it could be cut down to at least 2:10 rather than almost 2:40, it would be really beneficial.

Nobody really stands out, but they all turn in solid performances. In addition, M. Night Shyamalan does a great job building suspense and keeping us on the edge of our seats throughout. Heck, I even like the twist here. In many ways, I find it to be creepier than the other most likely explanation for what is happening in this village. Yet, aside from the look of the film, the terrifying atmosphere, and the score, nothing is truly great about this one. The story is interesting, but overall, the film lacks a certain \""wow\"" factor, leaving it as simply slightly above average. I am surprised at the hostility towards the twist here, because again, I quite liked it.

Unfortunately, however, it seems as though the film has received quite the unfair shake because of its inaccuracy. Many reviews upon its release and to this day lament the fact that King Arthur (Clive Owen) was a Roman officer in the film stationed in Britain, though he was born a Brit. It is this historical inaccuracy that seems to have led many people to write it off and, unfortunately, it is not helped by the fact that it is directed by Antoine Fuqua and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who are certainly not names that inspire hope. Yet, somehow, King Arthur turns out alright in the end if you approach it will a clear mind. Featuring excellent cinematography, terrific battles, and good performances all around, the film may have an occasionally clunky script, but it remains a terrifically structured action film."", ""The film's greatest weakness has to be its characters. As with many action films of this type, King Arthur suffers from not developing its characters nearly enough on an  individual level. Yet, it makes up for this with great group dynamics. The brotherhood between Arthur and his knights - Lancelot (Ioan Gruffuld), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone), and Dagonet (Ray Stevenson) - is always top-notch. The friendship flows readily and any jokes play well due to the chemistry shared between the men. Yet, where this group development really works is in the action scenes as we see one of them engaging in battle. No matter who it is, we want to see them win or be rescued just before their certain demise due to the impact their death would have on their others. This film is much about the Knights of the Roundtable as it is about Arthur as there is no Arthur with his Knights and no Knights without Arthur. Together, they combine to form an excellent group of people that begin to falter when looked at on an individual level."", ""The film's dialogue can also be quite clunky and its narrative is not always the best, particularly the awful narration at the beginning and end delivered by Lancelot that tries to communicate the legend of King Arthur because the rest of the film missed the mark on the topic. If there is any fault of the film it is the attempt to try and make it appear like a legend, even if the film itself is incredibly gritty and dirty. It tries to doll up a film not built to be dolled up and winds up missing the mark on the magical side of things entirely, while worsening the gritty side. This narration is the source of the issue and tries to tie the events we have and will witness into some overall legend that, during many sequences in the film, seems to be complete background noise compared to this gritty tale."", ""That said, where this film truly soars is in the visuals. Fuqua's go to move here is to juxtapose the cold blues, greens, whites, and grays, of Britain with gorgeous bright orange fires or skies completely absorbed by a yellow ray of sunlight. Shots of Arthur and his men walking through the forest with snow falling and everything in the forest washed out in blue with just a hint of yellow peaking out from above is one such highlight. By the time they reach the camp, shots of the camp from a hill as it burns or of the Saxon army led by Cedric (Stellan Skarsgard) shown trampling around the green hills or entering the burning village with smoke billowing all around them, also create a sense of awe as we see not just beautiful images, but the size of the attacking army. Finally, shots of Woads, as led by Guinevere (Keira Knightley), shooting flaming arrows that, juxtaposed against the blue sky, seem to be falling from the sky itself, is incredibly striking. King Arthur's knack of stirring imagery, emphasized by an excellent blending of warm and cold colors, is what cements it is as a gorgeous film that really captures the eye."", ""The film also greatly benefits from excellent action set pieces that make great use of Fuqua's astute eye for gorgeous images, while also crafting unique battles that entertain terrifically. Such scenes as the battle on the frozen lake show a keen sense of strategy and how to make a battle tense and well-staged. Taking its time to get everybody in position and not rushing through the scenes, the battles show a lot of attention to detail, even if they can get a bit absurd (breaking the ice with an axe). Where it gets silly, King Arthur manages to still entertain via excellent special effects and that aforementioned choreography, which simultaneous highlights the brutality of war, but also shows the grace and odd beauty of watching two armies clash."" ]";5

Jamie Foxx also does well as the cab driver and Mark Ruffalo makes a solid supporting appearance in this one as well. The thrills are also certainly there and, though implausible at times, they are most plentiful at the end of the film, though, really, you could be on the edge of your seat for much of this one. Overall, however, I cannot help but feel like this one was nothing but pretty good. Michael Mann's direction is great as always here, but this one never really \""reaches for the stars\"", rather it is content to just be a relatively straightforward and entertaining movie. Now, there is nothing wrong with that, but it certainly would have been nice to see that extra little bit given. Without it, it honestly feels like something is missing from this one."" ]";5

The soundtrack and singing from them both is just fantastic as well and really make the film. In terms of story, it is nothing more than solid. As a biography, it suffers from being about a person, but even then, the things they included all felt very formulaic, in the sense it only included Hollywood-esque material. In addition, it feels all too brief. I am glad it chose to focus a little more closely on some things, but considering it stops in 1966, it seems like there is so much they left out, considering he lived until 2003. They all really did not show why he was so influential on musicians that followed him. However, all the same, this one is more about the performances and the music, both of which are marvelous. Thus, while it is not perfect, as a biographical film about a musician, it hits the right notes."" ]";5
1298;i-robot;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""From what I understand, this is a terrible adaptation of Isaac Asimov collection of stories, though that criticism can similarly be applied to Stanley Kubrick's classic film The Shining, which is a terrible adaptation of the Stephen King novel. To me, that is a non-issue. At face value, this film is very entertaining, very well directed by Alex Proyas, very well acted by Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan, and very interesting when it comes to the questions it raises about creation and robots. It stays relatively constrained and believable when it comes to its science fiction ideas and though this may not be the way things are in 2035, it is relatively believable that this could come to fruition. The few plot twists that are here are also interesting and very much throw you for a loop at times. It is well paced, well written as well, though my main complaint was some blatant product placement for Converse and Audi. These do not usually bother me, but the Converse ones were particularly obvious and clearly shoehorned in later on. Overall, I, Robot is not a seminal science fiction by any means, but is a very, very well made one that entertains in spades and features enough heady thrills and a very well thought out future to make it a very good film."" ]";5

Matt Damon is still dynamic as the titular Jason Bourne. The action can be a little hectic, which is what holds this one back a bit, as it can be hard to follow during the action sequences. It can also get a little bogged down in the details like all spy flicks, but all the same, this is a very good action spy thriller. Director Paul Greengrass certainly knows what he is doing and knows how to tell a good story. The film is thrilling, the score is good, and the cinematography has moments of absolute brilliance (the shot of Bourne walking to his car in snow covered Russia comes to mind). Overall, The Bourne Supremacy is a good film that manages to entertain in spades even if it does nothing different from other spy films."" ]";5

Incredibly funny and cute, The Terminal features a great performance by Tom Hanks that really exceeds the overall quality of the film. It is incredibly safe and adverse to taking too many risks, but still manages to be an interesting look at this man's life in an airport after a crisis in his home nation leaves him stateless. Regardless, it is very entertaining and can be quite charming and moving at times in ways that only Spielberg films can. Somehow, that movie magic is still present in this film set solely in an airport terminal."" ]";5
1301;short-cuts;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""An ambitious, cynical, and character driven film, Short Cuts is loosely plotted, but always engaging. Critiquing modern society, marriages, infidelity, and more, Short Cuts is a film with a ton of moving pieces, courtesy of a variety of storylines. Each storyline and set of characters interacts with others in very natural ways that link their stories. Above all, it really shows how flawed we all are and the fragility, mistrust, and lies, that permeate modern day marriage. Through these vignettes, it quickly becomes clear that Altman has a very cynical opinion towards modern day marriage and people's ability to remain faithful to their spouse and not act in their own self-interest."", ""One of the best portions of this film is the acting. With such a large cast, obviously there are a lot of terrific actors and boy do they every display it in this film. Leading the way is Julianne Moore. As an eccentric artist who largely paints nude women, she portrays Marian Wyman. Married to Dr. Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine), she and Modine share one of the best scenes in the film. Confronting his wife about an event three years ago when he believes she cheated on him, the moment is intense and incredibly powerful. Moore's performance in this moment really hits a fever pitch of intensity and emotional rawness that define her character. She is very open throughout and even does this scene without her pants, which really shows what makes her character tick. She is raw and a passionate person and Moore really captures this brilliantly, especially in this moment. Alongside her, Jennifer Jason Leigh is often scene stealing here. Appearing as Lois Kaiser, a married mother of two who is a sex line worker, one of the funniest encounters of the film is her talking dirty to a customer, which upsets her husband. Wondering why she does not talk to him like that, her reaction to this apparent absurdity and comical reaction to her work is hysterically put together, bolstered by Leigh's performance."", ""Yet, what is really impressive is the writing. Thinly plotted, the film is never anything less than engrossing. It keeps you fully engaged and entertained throughout because of the writing. The characters are nuanced, with most of them being neither fully good or bad. They all act, talk, and walk like real people. Robert Altman introduces a variety of characters and uses them brilliantly to explore the state of marriage and the turmoil that ensues. Issues regarding infidelity, different desires, lack of passion, death of children, and depression, all ensue and are beautifully depicted. The acting helps here, as it is all very grounded and authentic, but the writing is really what creates this impact. Instead of introducing storylines and dropping them, Altman delves into them and shows them from varying perspectives. In one relationship, a man cheats. In another, the woman cheats. How is the dynamic different? This is explored in Short Cuts, as well as other marital issues that can arise. All are given the heft and weight they demand, which is a real treat to watch unfold."", ""For a three hour long film, Short Cuts honestly feel quite short. Its acting and writing is so engrossing, it never slacks. Compared to Altman's past film of this type, Nashville, it is hypnotic. While Nashville is a great film, it does sometimes feel its length. Short Cuts, however, is streamlined and consistently powerful. That said, the comparisons to Nashville are apt as they are not just Altman films, but both use music in interesting fashions. Through Tess Trainer (Annie Ross) and her singing in a club, which brings a few characters into the bar, we hear songs such as \""To Hell with Love\"" or \""Prisoner of Life\"". Thematically, these are great fits as the film largely explores the pain that can come from marriage and the problems that arise. Yet, having a spouse and kids, as most of the characters do, can leave one feeling trapped and stuck with their current way of life, even if its unhappy. This is a constant in Altman's films and Short Cuts is hardly an exception as, though he explores dark themes here, it is done through music and the musical choices accentuate the thematic excursions."", ""A poetic and moving look at life, marriage, and death, the film explores issues that can arise once we are married. The animosity, loss of passion, or infidelity, that plagues modern marriages are on full display in Short Cuts with brilliant writing and acting to boot, which does its sensitive subject tremendous justice. Honestly, this is as near to a masterpiece as I have seen in my mild binge on Robert Altman in the past few weeks."" ]";5
1302;hero;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A beautiful masterstroke from director Zhang Yimou, Hero is a beautifully constructed wuxia film that is infused with history, Chinese culture, honor, and themes of overcoming hate and the pain that can be caused from not conquering that hate. Through this film, Zhang Yimou not only creates a terrifically entertaining martial arts action film, but he also creates a film that is a moving and stirring look at the unification of China and the sacrifices that went into that monumental step."", """", ""With beautiful cinematography to soak up every inch of the screen, Hero shows an adept use of shot composition and construction to go along with the cinematography. Used in conjunction, the significant moving pieces of each shot and the capturing of those moves creates a truly gorgeous film that is breathtaking to view. From beginning to end, Zhang's film presents a unique and melodic look at its action. Personally, my favorite shot comes when our nameless warrior (Jet Li) enters the palace of the King of Qin (Chen Daoming). The long shots in this sequence are incredible and truly soak up the entirety of the beauty of the location."", """", ""Additionally, Zhang's constant use of color in the film is incredible, namely in the battle between Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Moon (Zhang Ziyi). The changing color of the leaves is an incredible site and the significance unashamedly escapes me, but is a beautiful use of color all the same. When it comes to the battles, the Zhang's use of color emerges continuously and it is always incredible to view."", """", ""Now, of course, the main focus of these types of films are the battle sequences. As the film progresses, each battle sequence takes on new meaning, but is always steeped in Chinese culture and the Chinese concept of honor. These ideals, along with the ideals of a warrior, blend perfectly into terrific choreography of each fight with good special effects throughout. For those unfamiliar with wuxia films, seeing people flying can be a bit much. However, Zhang keeps this supernatural element restrained with a deeply human story and deeply human battles. Though they have unusual abilities, their hearts and souls and apparent for all to see."", """", ""(SPOILERS) Thematically, Hero's beauty is continued with a terrific take on the power of hatred. Driven to assassinate the King of Qin due to the King's killing of his family, the nameless warrior manages to overcome his hatred due to Broken Sword (Tony Leung). Moved by his words, \""Our Land\"", the warrior is unable to kill the King because he now understands the motives behind his attempts to unify China. Though he is killed for this, the scene of their mutual understanding is beautiful and wonderfully scripted. However, the film continues on this theme as it shows Flying Snow kill Broken Sword due to his refusal to kill the King. Upon killing her love, she realizes just what her hate brought her: personal anguish. Zhang's execution of this theme is wonderful to watch and underscores the brilliance of Hero, which transcends borders and is a deeply human film, not just one aimed at Chinese audiences."", """", ""Overall, Hero is a beautifully crafted film that really shows its beauty in its cinematography, color, choreography, and in its themes. This is a masterful film from director Zhang Yimou that showcases all of the best qualities of wuxia genre, while also balancing the more unnatural elements with a deeply human story that is relatable for all."" ]";5

Now the film is not great, but it is very entertaining. Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Kate Ashfield, are all very good in their roles and their chemistry is great. The direction from Edgar Wright is smart and assured. The script is also very good and is loaded with witty dialogue and laughs. The laughs are ultimately the king here, as without the comedy, this one is alright. The thrills and excitement during the zombie sequences are good and certianly very intense, but at times, it can get a bit too gory. There are a few scenes that come to mind particular as being particularly gory and very much over the top. While the humor and thrills are good, I do wish they had toned down that aspect a little. I get that there will be gore in a zombie movie, but this one went overboard in some scenes, which was too bad. Luckily, however, the whole package is solid and very well done. As my first Edgar Wright film, it was a nice introduction to him."" ]";5

The costume design was brilliant and felt very time appropriate for the period it was set in.  I loved some of the shots from this one. Really some beautiful gems that knocked me on my ass here, including one particularly ravishing shot of Knightley standing on the edge of a cliff. Great, great stuff there. On top of that, it was really well adapted from Jane Austen's novel, which I have never read, but have obviously heard quite a bit about. For a romance film, I did not find it necessarily romantic (though it certainly is), rather it works quite well as a period piece from the late 18th century, which is enough for me. Thanks to great acting, strong direction, good writing, and some really gorgeous shots, Joe Wright's Pride & Prejudice is a winner."" ]";5
1305;born-on-the-fourth-of-july;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Most war films are focused upon the horror of war as it is experienced in the battlefield. The accidental killing of civilians, friendly fire, and the terror facing the enemy are all well-trodden territory and Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July portrays them through the eye of Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise). However, what separates this film from other war pictures is that it quickly moves away from those horrors. As hinted in the film's nostalgic and sentimental 1950s America first act, this is not a film about the carnage of war as it relates to the carnage itself. Rather, it is a film about what that carnage does to a person's mind, their body, and their spirit. How one encounter with the enemy can damage them for the rest of their life and alienate them from the world that one embraced them so eagerly. Born on the Fourth of July is a film about the things that many wish to overlook as being facts of war and the fact of fighting on behalf of one's country. This is a film about the dirty details that are inconvenient regardless of the side you are on."", ""Ron Kovic, a real man who wrote the book upon which the film is based, is a paraplegic from the chest down. Unable to walk or have sex, he feels like he is not a man anymore. Worse, he killed one of his own men in Vietnam and was partially responsible for the death of babies while there. In the hospital, he is greatly mistreated with nurses fighting him, threatening him with amputation, and telling him his sacrifice was worthless. Doctors never see him, all because they are overloaded due to demand with no budget whatsoever. At home, he is alienated from his family as they struggle to adjust to his paralysis and as he struggles to acclimate back into life at home. Drowning his sorrows in alcohol and prostitutes while feeling ostracized from anti-war protesters who hate what he represents and pro-war folks who hate that he is a reminder of the human cost of war, Ron Kovic is a truly tragic figure throughout the entire film. His tale is a moving and powerful one that calls to attention the one element we always forget: our veterans."", ""As an anti-war person myself, it is easy to see why veterans in America have been forgotten. As Ron figures out, nobody wants him. Too often anti-war protests turn against those who fought instead of focusing on the true source of evil: the government that corrupted those boys and girls minds and convinced them that this was worth their life. On the other side, the pro-war folks ignore the veterans equally as much as they are a reminder of the fact that war kills, maims, and damages completely. Politically, this winds up being the democrats who do not support veterans out of fear of seeing too pro-war to their base and republicans who do not support veterans because, well, they should be able to pay their own way and not rely on handouts (in essence, passing the buck so they do not need to think about them). The only ones who get hurt by this are veterans. It is tragic to see this film come out in 1989 and, yet, we are still here in 2017 wondering why the VA is awful and why we let so many veterans become homeless and unemployed."", ""In portraying this character, Cruise approaches it with great sensitivity. Perhaps, his turn as Ron Kovic is the most nuanced performance he has given in his career. Deftly portraying him as an unquestioned patriot before the war to a man who slowly realizes he was fed lies all these years, Cruise's depiction is heart breaking and entirely moving. Alongside him, however, both Raymond J. Barry and Caroline Kava give terrific performances as his parents. Both lost and confused about how to handle their son after the war, the two try their best. Eli (Barry) acts like a father and builds Ron everything he needs. He tries to essentially rebuild his son, which he knows to be futile, but he tries anyways. Patricia (Kava) struggles more openly, especially when Ron's anger and PTSD gets into full swing and he lashes out at everybody around him. For her, her son died in Vietnam and the man that came back in his place is a cruel and mean impostor. It is a nearly impossible mental hurdle to overcome and Kava's raw performance embodies just how challenging it is to see somebody you love be so impacted by something you wish you could fix immediately for them."" ]";5
1306;philadelphia;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""After catching flack for his portrayal of transsexuals in The Silence of the Lambs (still my favorite film), director Jonathan Demme returned two years later with Philadelphia. An urgent and deeply important film about raising awareness to individuals suffering from AIDS and pulling back the stigma surrounding the illness, Philadelphia is an often powerful film for this very reason. Yet, make no mistake, this film is hardly a full-throated endorsement of gay rights by Demme. Rather, it is a step. It is a step towards acceptance of the lifestyle, as the film essentially argues that it is not unnatural to be gay, nor is it something to be looked down upon. Homosexuals are people like anybody else and deserve to be treated as such, even if you do not approve of their lifestyle. As of 2016, we have obviously come much further with gay rights, but for 1993, Philadelphia was practically a revelation. In spite of its previous timeliness, however, Philadelphia is a largely predictable and typical courtroom drama that rides on great acting to really accomplish anything whatsoever."", ""As with all courtroom dramas, Philadelphia's conclusion is clear from the beginning. If you do not know that Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) will win the case, then you have never seen a courtroom film before. As such, reaching the conclusion is inherently tedious when rarely (if ever?) has a courtroom film ended up by reversing the cliche. The protagonists win and the antagonists lose. End story. Thus, while the film spends a lot of time in the courtroom, this only hurts the end product. The drama is outside of the court, not inside of it and, often, Demme loses sight of this in the film. After a certain point, he just settles into showing us testimony and the prejudiced beliefs of those around him in the office and that was why he was fired. While it was a wrongful termination, the film scores no dramatic points for this."", ""Also hindering the film is the opening. Slow and meandering, the film really never hits its emotional stride until after Andrew meets with Joe Miller (Denzel Washington). In the opening, Hanks' acting is spotty at best and the film is largely just an introduction to his illness and his life as a whole. While these moments are effectively told, they are simply never that intriguing, as it is merely the foundation of the case which, again, is never that interesting."", ""However, once that meeting between Andrew and Joe does happen, Philadelphia hits its stride quite solidly. Here, we find Andrew - a gay man suffering from AIDS - opening up the worldview of his lawyer, Joe Miller. Deeply anti-gay and bigoted, Joe has a violent hatred for homosexuals and finds their lifestyle deeply disgusting. Once he meets Andrew, however, his world begins to change and he sees gays completely differently. In many ways, Joe is intended to mirror the audience in 1993 who, entering the film with extreme prejudice, wind up leaving with an understanding and compassion for gays worldwide. While they may not fully accept them yet, there is no longer that hatred, which is an important hurdle to cross. To be clear, Joe does not like gays or understand them by the end of the film, but he is more accepting of their lifestyle and no longer carries the weight of hatred he once held."", ""Denzel Washington brings Joe to life brilliantly, from the man filled with vile hatred to the man who learns compassion from his encounters with Andrew. Meanwhile, Hanks brilliant as Andrew Beckett. Though initially spotty, once the disease begins ravishing Andrew, Hanks really begins to shine. He compassionately brings to light the suffering experienced by AIDS patients and does a terrific job capturing this pain and torment. This is where Demme's film is so truly important, as it humanizes the suffering and does not make it appear other. It shows the suffering of AIDS patients to be no different than anybody else's suffering. They may be gay, but that is okay and it is not a reason for them to suffer, which was previously a belief held by many. The film does not spare us the gory details of the toll AIDS has on the body and, for this, it makes it far more intimate and hits close to home for everybody in the audience."", ""Philadelphia is a slight and cliche film about an important topic, which is really unfortunate. Though Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks are terrific in the film, Philadelphia never diverts from courtroom drama cliches enough to really breathe life into the film. Yet, what does breathe some life into the film is Demme's sensitive handling of a very timely and vitally crucial issue: the AIDS epidemic. Bringing to light the suffering of those with AIDS, Philadelphia manages to play an important role in raising awareness to the issue of gay rights in America."" ]";5

The film is just as odd and truly all over the place as I imagine his films were and it just feels right. The film can feel a bit distant, but that said, it does paint a good picture of Wood and is incredibly sympathetic towards his delusion and while it is a comedy at times, the film can be pure drama and tragedy as you watch him fail. Ed Wood is a very funny film at times with some seriously laugh out loud moments and the film does a good job balancing this with drama and Wood's story. Johnny Depp also just happens to be brilliant as Wood, both in light and dark moments. Overall, Tim Burton's weirdo biopic on this weirdo man is a gem."" ]";5
1308;before-sunset;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A continuation of Richard Linklater's \""stream of consciousness\"" romance trilogy, Before Sunset is better than Before Sunrise, but not by much, because both are still phenomenal pieces of cinema. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are yet again fantastic in this film with their chemistry together on display for all to see. The two of them seem to just bounce off of one another and it gives the love between them a realistic feeling. Featuring the same hilarious moments, honest and riveting dialogue, and pure romance, as the first film, the thing that puts Before Sunset above Before Sunrise for me is the way in which the characters have grown. In the first film, they are innocent. They are both romantics who may not be open about this due to parts of their past, but deep down, they believe in love and \""the one\"". Now, both are jaded and unhappy. Yet, though they claim otherwise, both are still romantics. They are simply both afraid to be hurt further and show the scars of love lost. There is a longing between both of them that has left both unsatisfied in other endeavors. Their dialogue suggests they are now both cynics who no longer believe in love, but in reality, it portrays them as people who deny their true feelings because they are afraid of it falling apart all over again. For this, Before Sunset shows great maturity amid its romance that leaves hope for the future, yet that hope is tempered and covered in doubt. What will happen? Will they find happiness? A brilliant film, Before Sunset shows Richard Linklater's talent as a writer and director for all to see."" ]";5

From its compelling premise that really hooks you in from the very beginning to the absolutely stunningly good performance from Meryl Streep, The Manchurian Candidate has some real high notes. Liev Schrieber also turns in a reliably good performance in this film from director Jonathan Demme that keeps you on your toes and thrills continuously from beginning to end. That said, it does have a few problems. With its compelling premise, things at the end should have would wound up being far messier. Unfortunately, its too neat ending left me more than disappointed. Additionally, the editing can be a bit spotty with some really weird transitions and scenes seemingly lacking flow here and there.

With some gorgeous shots of Wyoming in its back pocket, Ang Lee's romantic western is a moving portrayal of gay love in a time when it was unacceptable to the majority of society. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal have undeniable chemistry and their love is believable. However, I have many problems with their romance, which prevents me from loving the film. Firstly, Lee decides to show them eating beans and then bang, all of a sudden, they are lovers. Though there is sexual tension between them beforehand, it seems odd that in a time when being gay is so taboo, two men would quickly rush into sex."", """", ""Secondly, the film skims through years and opts to ignore the negative side of this romance. Yes, these two love each other. However, what about their wives (Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway)? What about their children? Not only are they both adulterers, but they ignore their spouses and children repeatedly in the film. I get that they are repressed homosexuals, which is obviously terrible, but it makes it hard for me to feel sympathy for two men who are so morally repugnant. The only mistake these women made was marrying a man who is gay, which apparently makes them deserving of being cheated on. There is no sympathy for the struggles of our gay lovers due to their lack of respect for the women in their lives and, heck, even their own kids. Ennis (Ledger) very clearly never sees his daughters. By the end, he only has a relationship with one (Kate Mara). How is this okay? Lee makes some effort to condemn the deception to Ennis' wife, but quickly reverts to trying to make us feel sympathy for him once more."", """", ""That said, their relationship is undeniably electric. Though I have problems with the rushing of it all, Lee does expertly counter this by showing Gyllenhaal's initial hesitation to rush things with Hathaway. Through this, we are able to see his true colors and sexual desires. It is also showcased in his interactions with Hathaway and Ledger. While with his wife, he clearly lacks passion and is on edge. With Ledger, he is loose, free, and head over heels. Lee develops this angle brilliantly."", """", ""Additionally, the ending sequence made me into a believer. The clothing, the photo, and the trauma Ennis faces at the end, really hit home. In order for non-gay viewers to truly overcome any prejudices, this scene is almost a much, because it shows how real their love is for them. They did not choose this life. Instead, it was who they are. This is ever present in this scene and is truly the dramatic and romantic triumph of this film. While the development of the romance felt off for me, the ending was easily the best part of this film."", """", ""Brokeback Mountain is beloved by many. For me, it is a good western and good romance, but simply never commits to actually developing the romance, instead opting to fast forward to the \""good bits\"" with no build-up. Even worse, it never fully condemns the more reprehensible actions of Ennis and Jack. That said, the emotional power and force of this film is impossible to deny."" ]";5

The difficulty of joint custody and the separation of one's parents is represented here on two very different children. Also interesting is the division between \""intellectuals\"" and \""philistines\"" and their characterization in the film. In many regards, the former are portrayed quite negatively, even being shown as frauds.

Perhaps, in writing this review, it is a good time to admit one of my greatest cinematic sins: I really do not see the hype with Alfonso Cuaron. In fact, I really do not like his work all that much. Having seen all but two of his films, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is something in his films that really turns me off. They look, feel, and sound like cinematic classics, but lack that crucial element to make them truly soar above the competition, when they are good as is the case with Prisoner of Azkaban and Gravity. While A Little Princess left me feeling a little indifferent, I found Children of Men to be impeccably underwhelming and I really had to gut it through Y Tu Mama Tambien, which was one of the worst films I have ever seen due to how juvenile, crude, and vulgar of a film it turned out to be. Yet, in saying all of this, I let myself get overhyped for Prisoner of Azkaban due to word of mouth and the presence of Cuaron. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me five times, definitely shame on me at this point."", ""What really holds the film back is how rushed everything feels. While the film's plotting is surprisingly tight and lacking in exposition and diversions into various wacky elements of the wizarding world, the film is a weird position. It is still a long film (though shorter than its predecessors), but feels far more rushed than either of them. It would have been better served being as long as the other films, even though those films were hurt by their length. By further developing scenes, characters, and dialogue, the film would feel more adequately paced instead of being a speeding bullet to the finish line. The film's climax and falling action are particularly susceptible to this with the film ditching its slow build-up to revealing Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), exploring the dementors, and building fantastic atmospheric tension. With the film introducing time travel during the climax, quickening the pace is perhaps a technique used by Cuaron to make the film less repetitive. However, the quickened pace really undermines the most important of the film: Harry meeting his godfather Sirius and learning the truth behind his parent's death. Instead of letting the emotional weight of this reveal take hold, the film rushes through and then half-heartedly tries to go back to these moments with characters explaining exactly how they felt, such as when Harry explains the secrets behind the encounter by the lake to Hermione. It is admittedly a series aimed at children, yet like its predecessors, it feels the need to explain details that are either inconsequential or obvious to the children in the audience. As a result of this, the film never really convinces anybody regarding Sirius' turn around from lead villain to kind godfather. Harry seems all too willing to believe anything about this man who he was told was loyal to Voldemort. It makes no sense, even if the film does it best to try and go back to convince you it made sense. It is touching, sure, but Cuaron never really made the moment feel earned or realistic. Thus, the film feels rather lacking in heart and soul. It has spirit for sure, but feels far too pedestrian and safe to really knock it out of the park, which is a real Cuaron trademark."", ""That said, Cuaron really does add some terrific touches in bringing the novel to life. Taking the Spielbergian child-like wonder of Chris Columbus' first two films and blending it with a much darker world, the first hour of the Prisoner of Azkaban is a master class in atmospheric tension. Starting off with the ominous train ride in which the dementors are introduced and the groundwork for Sirius Black's shocking escape from Azkaban prison is laid out, the film becomes both a treat for the eyes via good special effects and a thrilling experience. With the slow reveal of the dementors via the freezing of the bus and their terrifying encounter with Harry on the train, Cuaron sets the scene perfectly for just how terrifying these figures will become in the film, often far exceeding Sirius' menacing exterior in the beginning. It is honestly this tremendous build-up for Sirius with such an ominous feeling in the air whenever he is mentioned that the film's ending feels so unconvincing. Fortunately, that build-up is so good, it is hard to deny that the film is a truly haunting and mesmerizing experience for much of its runtime."", ""Cuaron also smartly takes advantage of the design of Hogwarts to add to the ominous nature of the film.

1313;dawn-of-the-dead;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The first Zack Snyder film I have enjoyed and it is largely because it is not his typical brand of childish filmmaking. Not just a film where he smashes toys together and laughs maniacally like a seven year old, Snyder is largely restrained here. Instead, it just plays like a typical zombie movie and, in that regard, it is a pretty good film. Tense, thrilling, and truly entertaining, Dawn of the Dead gets a little dead in the middle, but its beginning and conclusion are both terrific and laced with moments that pushed me right to the edge of my seat."", ""From the beginning, we are introduced to Ana Clark (Sarah Polley). Set to experience the zombie apocalypse first hand, Ana somehow manages to escape the clutches of the zombies in her home and find other survivors. Together, they migrate to the Crossroads Mall, where they find shelter with other survivors. Once there, they bring in more survivors and discover cliche things about zombies, such as being bitten turns you into one and to kill them, you must shoot them in the head. Hardly revolutionary in this, Dawn of the Dead does hit the brakes once they get to the mall and instead opts to show these \""revelations\"" and show the people passing time. Yet, what is exhilarating is whenever they encounter zombies. Heart racing and action-packed in these moments, Dawn of the Dead shows that Snyder knows how direct thrilling scenes and create a great atmosphere that leaves on edge. Whether it is early or late in the film, moments with the zombies are always great."", ""Yet, the film does do some very interesting things. Not only is there a zombie baby, which just has to be unique to this film, and an inventive way of escaping, Dawn of the Dead features incredibly smart characters. Knowing their situation is hopeless, the characters cut the weak links down and do what they can to survive. There are very few stupid actions (other than Natalie going for Chips), but these are hardly prevalent and do actually get worked into the film pretty nicely. The inventive solution to get away, though silly on the surface, is a very good addition to this film and makes it feel somewhat unique. Instead of taking a final stand or having some cure occur, Dawn of the Dead let's its characters figure out an escape route themselves."", ""The film, as an action film, is incredibly entertaining. With great tension and good action set pieces, Snyder's typically strong visual style is somewhat here as watching zombies get their brains shot out has never really looked so nice. The zombie design is very good and the film's inventive plot solution comes through in nice action set pieces and an interesting design on the escape vehicle that really give the film a unique edge that make it compelling. However, the film does have some problems. Its wide range of characters are pretty awful. None of them really grab you and pull you in, rather it is just a collection of white people and a couple black guys fighting some zombies. The characters are never differentiated from one another in a significant fashion and, as such, they sort of just blend together. The film's plot also loses steam in the middle when Snyder just shows a montage of the characters engaging in sex, talk about gay relationships, and playing golf. Now, I did see the director's cut, so this may not apply to the theatrical cut. These moments just exist to pass time and do not advance the plot at all (and not just because I could tell which girl had sex since the white blonde girls look similar here at times, though I think the guy was Ty Burrell maybe). Just excessive and doing really nothing the momentum of the plot, these moments are an unfortunate addition to an otherwise tight film. It also feels odd due to the inclusion of a pastor speaking about why this is happening and blaming it on various sins. By including them, it feels as though Snyder is being a bit of his childish self as the pastor is just there to be mocked and have that same sin rubbed back in his face. Whether you agree with it or not, this moment does feel kind of awkward and useless for the rest of the film."", ""Fortunately, Dawn of the Dead is an action-packed and thrilling experience. With good special effects and thrilling moments a plenty, Dawn of the Dead defines the hopelessness of the genre (especially with the ending), but also shows the power of teamwork. I just wish that people in zombie movies had seen at least one zombie movie in their life so we can skip past the \""you have to shoot them in the head\"" and \""if you get bitten you turn into a zombie\"" moments that are in each of these films."" ]";5

On the surface, this one is absolutely hilarious. There are numerous scenes that have you laughing out loud, especially ones with Peter Sellers and/or George Scott. Luckily, Sellers plays three roles so we get to see a lot of him and he really helped put this one over the top for me. It is amazing to me that this one is still a riot considering that it was released 50 years ago, but it goes to show that good films transcend time and this one fits the bill completely. In addition to being funny, it is a great political thriller as we watch everything unfold in the film.

Lindsay Lohan is also great and this should have been a star-making turn for her and watching this makes me sad thinking of all the lost potential for her.

Plus, even though is focuses on the problems facing girls in high school, a lot of the things they discuss about high school rings true all the same.

Showcasing significant paranoia about cults, the government, and new technology, Videodrome is a truly unique and thoroughly Cronenberg (read: weird) experience. Packed to the brim with his trademark body horror, this one is quite a ride."", """", ""As with his later exercises in eXistenZ, Videodrome showcases oddly solid special effects that seem so real that you could reach out and touch the torso vagina bursting out of Max Renn (James Woods). Many Cronenberg films have these oddly realistic looking body horror sequences that never seem comical, but downright horrifying. The Fly had a lot of these elements as well and it really demonstrates Cronenberg's wheelhouse. He knows body horror better than anybody and he is not afraid to showcase his skill in this arena. In spite of his manipulation of the reality around us and within his typically realistic settings, the films always feel so horrifically real. Though exaggerations of the world around us, films such as Videodrome often mirror seedy elements of our world and bring them to us in a thoroughly visceral manner. While things such as those depicted in this film would not happen, some form of them certainly does (namely cults, non-literal mind control, snuff films, and the \""subterrainian market\""). Cronenberg has a knack for bringing these elements to the forefront of our mind and is truly horrifying."", """", ""The film's usage of alternate realities is also splendid as, once the concept is introduced, you can never truly be sure what is a hallucination. Hell, everything could be. Is there even a show called Videodrome or is Max Renn just psychotic? How much of this happened? Did he ever actually meet Nicki Brand (Debbie Harry) and others? There are so many possibilities and this is a prime example of how Cronenberg can mess with your mind. He not only distorts reality through his realistic settings and people juxtaposed against his body horror and unique special effects, but also through alternate timelines. Things that seem so real to Max appear to have been nothing but another hallucination. However, things can certainly go in the reverse and things that appear to be hallucinations could easily be reality. Things he imagined he hallucinated could have truly happened and the hallucination merely convinces him they did not. Weird, I know."", """", ""Cronenberg's toying with killing in the name of some movement or cult is another link one can draw to his later film eXistenZ (and I am sure others, that one just happens to be one I watched). In both films, characters kill people in the name of some movement. Here, Cronenberg makes it all the more horrifying by showing that everybody is playing for the same team and is truly being played, as we will soon all be under the control of \""Videodrome\"". This paranoia runs rampant throughout the film as one must one is Cronenberg keeps himself up at night wondering if he is under the control of some mysterious cult that is just waiting for the right moment to use him to further their goals. Poor guy. As it stands, he certainly has me paranoid after watching Videodrome. This film is dripping with paranoia in every shot, especially due to the acting of James Woods. An incredibly natural, everyman type actor (in spite of his clearly negative characterization, he seems relatively normal), his persona really brings a further level of horror to Videodrome. The paranoia he experiences and the violence he is forced to undergo feels so close to us, which makes it all the creepier."", """", ""As a whole, Videodrome is a very good body horror film from the master of the subgenre. Gleefully messing with our mind and our concepts of what can and cannot be real in the world and in film, this one showcases all that Cronenberg does well as a director. With significant paranoia, fear, and confusion in every sequence, you simply never know where everyone stands and what is actually occurring, which truly adds to the horror of it all."" ]";5
1317;after-hours;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""After Hours is either a ringing endorsement for cocaine or a cautious tale about what cocaine can do to the brain. With director Martin Scorsese channeling David Lynch's surreal approach to storytelling, After Hours tells the story of one man's really weird night as he tries to get home from the SoHo district in New York. Confronting dead girls, burned girls, weird girls, and an angry mob, Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne) is simply a man who wanted to have sex and got more than he ever bargained for. Truly an odd experience, After Hours is a film that feels so unlike anything else in Scorsese's filmography. While you can still feel his presence (and he has a cameo), it feels so odd to watch unfold. By comparison, The King of Comedy feels like a perfect fit in his filmography, that is how odd this film is to experience."", ""After Hours is one of those films where once it is watched, you spend the time after the runtime trying to figure out what the hell it was about and whether or not you liked it. One possible reading of this is in regards to castration and the danger women could pose to men. From the psychos he hangs out with to the image of the shark biting off a man's member, After Hours seems to be arguing that men need to be wary of weirdos. But, above all, Paul is the weirdo. Thus, while that seems to be what Wikipedia believes, it is not necessarily one that I believe fits the film. Rather, the shark biting of the man's member in the bathroom is more in line with business and working life. As shrewd business people are often called sharks (Shark Tank), After Hours could be seen as a warning to men and women alike about the threats of being a slave to work. From the encounter in his office where a co-worker expresses his desire to not work there forever, the waitress who hates her two jobs, the mob leader who drives an ice cream truck, and Paul looking up to the heavens and begging for mercy, for he is but a simple word processor, the film is all about work. Everybody hates their dead end jobs and want to quit. Yet, they show up and do the job anyways and float through the day as if they were ghosts. In many ways, After Hours is a surreal black comedy that shows the dangers of working life and how it leaves you susceptible to being attacked out in the world."", ""Yet, Scorsese's approach to the film feels so odd and so off-the-wall. With threats coming from every angle, Paul Hackett finds friendly faces around the corner, but they consistently turn against him and join the angry mob that accuses him of being a thief. The film just feels so abrasive and antagonistic against both its protagonist and the audience. We constantly feel claustrophobic and trapped in this hellish nightmare right alongside Paul and, as a result, this can be a tough watch at times. It is one where your expectations are consistently subverted with even more absurd happenings around every corner and whether or not they all work, they at least shock you."", ""Acting-wise, the film is solid. Lacking the true big names of many Scorsese films, Griffin Dunne still holds his own as a leading man in a Scorsese film. He plays the typically straight-laced and entirely frazzled Paul Hackett terrifically and really captures the necessary everyman notes. He is a guy who could be working in any office in America and be nothing but a normal guy. Thus, his response to this weird cast of characters feel entirely genuine and within range for a relatively normal guy who has a very, very bad night."", ""While After Hours is certainly a screwball black comedy, its comedy comes from the absurdity of what transpires. What transpires is the artists revolting on a man working for the sharks of the world that steal and trample on the little guy. An odd film from Scorsese, After Hours proves that cocaine is one hell of a drug and if you wish to experience this in your life, cocaine can certainly help you replicate Paul Hackett's wild and crazy night. But, if you do not wish to have an angry mob running through New York after you and be trapped in a paper mache statue, maybe lay off the cocaine."" ]";5
1318;suspicion;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Honestly, three-quarters into this movie, I had conceded that this one may just be a solid misfire from Alfred Hitchcock. It had suspense, but seemed to be taking too long to get to the point. Yes, Johnnie (Cary Grant) was creepy and a liar, but I needed a pay-off. My mind began to wander and it seemed like I had finally found a Hitchcock film that had missed the mark. However, even in this mixed state of mind, the film was admittedly incredibly suspenseful and filled with tension as you began to wonder, along with Lina (Joan Fontaine), if her husband Johnnie was really a dastardly murderer. What won me over was the third act. It is brilliant. Visceral, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, the third act must rank among the very best final acts of a film in Hitchcock's career. That said, in hindsight, the first and second acts are also often terrific in setting up the clues to the \""case\"" and hinting at the truth."", ""Deceitful and untrustworthy, Johnnie falls quickly into love with the rich Lina. Unbeknownst to Lina, Johnnie is a gambler, heavily in debt, and broke. Hitchcock immediately sets up the film to make Lina and the audience suspicious, especially after her father dies and Johnnie loses his job for stealing, but fails to tell Lina. He is no good and a thief, but is he a murderer? Lina seems unsure, but her paranoia and suspicion continue to spiral out of control. As a result, though it was lost on me initially, the audience's instincts also spike out of control. Every clue, every move, every action is draped in tension in the final act of the film. Sick from nerves, Lina is bed ridden. Johnnie bringing her milk, after learning of an undetectable and pain free poison found in every home, is filled with suspense. Hitchcock is the \""master of suspense\"" for good reason and he shows it here in this film. As she looks at the glass after Johnnie put it down, it makes the audience want to get up and scream, \""Do not touch that milk, it is poisoned!\"" When films make the audience feel such emotions, you can always tell just how effective its thrills and suspense are."", ""Cary Grant truly lives up to the billing as well, as his every move and look instills trepidation and fear. He seems like a snake and acts like one throughout the film. When he tries to convince Lina that he loves her and would never hurt her, it never feels genuine. It is almost as if he is convincing himself as well as his wife. His slimy, grimy, and despicable behavior leads to the belief that he is untrustworthy and, even worse, his lack of wealth and seedy nature easily instills the belief that he would kill Lina to get her money. As such, the film is filled with dread and suspense as we wait to see the lengths that he will go to in order to get out of the financial hole. As his wife, Joan Fontaine is terrific. She defines paranoia and fear as she quickly puts together the pieces of the puzzle that merely reinforce her mistrust of her husband. From dead friends, lies, cover-ups, theft, and more, her evidence is piling up. Fontaine perfectly captures this petrified wife character who solemnly realizes that she does not know her husband as well as she thought, as she has no idea if he could kill her."", ""The terrific final act is truly the cherry on top of this film, however. While the first and second acts are a mix of portions that do not work and Hitchcock firing on all cylinders, the final act truly saves it all. As they drive on an open road by a cliff, the tension and suspense of the moment is honestly overwhelming and leaves you clutching the seat to see what will happen next. It is here where the film's billing as a psychological thriller really pays off as the mental build-up in conjunction with that finale is incredible. This is a film that really messes with your mind and is honestly inconclusive. Though the ending seems to paint one picture, an argument for the exact opposite could be equally true. Johnnie is not a man who is easy to pin down, so his true nature is eternally elusive, so whether he is capable of truly killing or not."", ""Laced with tension and suspense, Suspicion is a tremendous earlier work in Hitchcock's filmography. While its first and second act are not as effective in the moment, they become great thanks to a phenomenal finale that leaves you guessing. As is typical, constant references to murder and the word itself are littered throughout and it is always compelling to see how Hitchcock keeps you wondering even if it is so apparent that murder plays a key role in this story. But, for him, the build-up and the mystery is key, just as it is here in Suspicion."" ]";5

Featuring many Coen Brothers trademarks, The Ladykillers is a very fun watch that may be a little odd at times and showcases the directorial/writing duo almost trying to outdo themselves on the weirdness scale, but it has a fun engaging cast of characters, is well-written, and has a very compelling narrative. Even better, the lunacy of the film makes it truly hysterical and like I already said, a truly great time. While it does not reach the heights of some other Coen Brothers classics, I do prefer it to some of their more subtle films and though I would not call it their best work, I would hard pressed to call it their worst either. Overall, The Ladykillers is vintage Coen Brothers, even if it received less than stellar reviews."" ]";5
1320;dawn-of-the-dead-1979;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Masking social commentary and satire under hundreds of pounds of splattered zombie brains and human intestines, George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is one of those films shows smart cinema does not need to be boring. Brilliantly crafted and thought-out social commentary is always on display in Dawn of the Dead, but the film nonetheless boasts a similarly impeccably constructed and thought-out representation of the zombie subgenre. As both a satire and horror film, Dawn of the Dead hits the mark, delivering both a thrill-ride of entertaining encounters and enough ideas to really leave you thinking after it is all over. As the follow-up to Romero's brilliant, Night of the Living Dead, the film similarly advances the horror set fort in the original, further setting up sequels that will continue to demonstrate the mayhem that is unfurling in, at first, Pennsylvania and, eventually, the world."", ""As a piece of social commentary, Dawn of the Dead perfectly nails both the mindless consumer and thoughtless consumption of the American consumer. This brilliantly constructed critique is exemplified in the setting of the film: a mall. A beacon of capitalism that can be heard around the world, this large mall plays host to the protagonists and the zombies. As they fight off the zombies inside in order to establish the mall as a safe haven for themselves, the protagonists wonder why the zombies are coming, only for one of them to explain why. Deep in the subconscious of the zombies are memories of this mall and all they know is they have to go there, but they do not know why. Throughout the mall, there are advertisements for sales and there is even an announcement promising hard candy to whoever spend a certain amount. This showcase of mindless consumers and the carrots dangled in front of them to entice them to buy underscores the ideas behind Dawn of the Dead with much of this commentary playing nicely as somewhat funny satire."", ""Romero takes it even further, however, and uses that as a jumping off point to show mindless consumption, even from those facing the zombies. As they race through a store, Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (David Emge) agree to grab whatever they might need. Thus, Peter grabs a television and a radio. While they do use it, it is likely that other items could have been more essential. The television later proves to be useless as there are no longer any broadcasts, which naturally aggravates the men in the room as they can no longer mindlessly watch television. Later, a group of bikers go through the same store and one of the members is chastised for trying to grab a television. Added together with the ideas regarding the mindless consumer, Romero shows the change of pace in Dawn of the Dead from Night of the Living Dead. In 'Night', as theorist Richard Dyer argued, the white people are often depicted as lifeless. All of the zombies are white, while one white woman who is not a zombie is catatonic. The protagonist there being a black man, who is meant to exemplify life. Here, Romero shows that, due to capitalism, it is no longer just the whites that are lifeless. Now, there are black and hispanic zombies in the bunch, who must similarly be killed by the black and white protagonists. What was once the plight of only whites has now advanced in the ten years between the two films with the entire human race now turned into mindless consumers who only know where to go to buy something, not what they want to buy."", ""Furthermore, Romero takes the race angle of 'Night' and updates it in 'Dawn' to show the true enemy in the film. Though the zombies are unrelenting and everywhere, they can be escaped without much fuss. A quick shot through the head and they are dealt with. The only become truly problematic when they sneak up on you or there is a gang of them. The same cannot be said for humanity. A human with a mind to commit crimes or express aggression can hardly be stopped as easily. Showcased through a SWAT officer with a hatred of Puerto Ricans and blacks who bursts into a building just to kill some or the bikers who come into the mall and cause more mayhem than the zombies, Romero showcases how it is humanity who is humanity's greatest enemy and predator. The zombies may be mindless, but at least they are equal opportunity and killing solely for necessity. Humans kill one another for any reason under the sun, whether it be hatred, accident, or - in the case of the bikers in the mall - for territory. Unlike zombies, the large armies of humans who stomp in to cause mayhem in a region are hardly as easily defeated unless you are willing to stand your ground and fight back."" ]";5

Crimson Tide really makes you think at times and wonder who is in the right. Additionally, Crimson Tide really has some good performances from Hackman and Washington who really bring the differences of their characters to the forefront and really play the roles perfectly.

Thoroughly evil, deceitful, and menacing, Pacino exudes evil here and plays the role perfectly, enticing the audience to both trust and fear him in unison as he wraps Reeves around his finger.

As for the direction, it is much better in the sequel than in the original, as the story told here (though it suffers from middle story issues of course) is much, much better. It is far more involved and far more interesting. The religious undertones are also ramped up a couple notches in this one, which is very interesting. The writing of the characters was also much better. I still loved R2-D2 and C-3PO, but finally started to like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca. Darth Vader also continues to be a great character and the introduction of Yoda in this one is a hugely positive addition.

In addition, the showdown between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, as well as that between the Emperor and Skywalker was riveting and really well done.

Even in 2004, terrific director Guillermo del Toro turns out just another superhero movie that follows the hero's journey throughout and has a horrible boring white male sidekick. Fortunately, Del Toro is such an impressive director, his stylistic inclinations rise above the tame and boring superhero material he is given in this film. Gothic with great mythology behind it, Hellboy is a compelling film with great visual effects and remains constantly engaging and compelling thanks to Del Toro and a stellar lead performance by Ron Perlman as the Nazi-summoned demon good guy. Unfortunately, the film is still derided by its lame and predictable story."", ""Opening in terrific fashion with Hellboy being summoned, his rescue, and then the introduction to the Paranormal Bureau headed by Trevor Broom (John Hurt), Del Toro manages to create great scope to the film. While it devolves into typical end of the world fare later on, the opening half hour with Hellboy fighting the hellhound in the museum and the introduction and usage of Abe Sapien is tremendous. If the entire film was just Hellboy and Abe Sapien kicking butt, I would have loved this film. But, instead, every comic book superhero movie must devolve into being a \""save the world\"" hero's journey and end up with lame fight scenes between our hero and the big bad guy. This makes the film feel incredibly stale, even if if was one of the first of the wave of superhero movies we have gotten in the 21st century. It bears all the lame and tame marks that continue to deride the genre as it feels sterilized and overly restrained from going in more interesting directions with its story. Instead, Hellboy was merely one of the first films that showed superheroes could be compressed into the hero's journey, regardless of who they are, and the film will turn out pretty good. If this came out next year, it would be an unchanged film and fit into the current trend just fine."", ""That said, Del Toro's gothic style and influence is all over this film with gorgeous shadowy locals and castles. This infuses the film with his visual style, which was always going to be a very, very good thing. The film greatly benefits from this, often rising above its superhero cliches. The gorgeous cinematography and awesome visual effects also play a role, especially when Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) is on fire. The shot of her and Hellboy kissing at the end with both enveloped in flame is terrific and a great lasting image from this film. Along with the poetic dialogue accompanying this final sequence, the finale - even in spite of the asinine fight scenes - is stellar and why I tune in no matter what Del Toro is attached to and directs. The film also suffers from Generic White Male Actor #7 and his large role in the film. He really adds nothing but bland dialogue, bland looks, bland stares, and bland communication. Compared to the lively and fully game Perlman and the always impeccable John Hurt, Rupert Evans is just so damn lame. I have no idea why del Toro added him in when the film was just fine without his addition. To paint him as a sort of \""knight\"" and hero in his own right was borderline comical as well. If this were from a lesser director, having an audience surrogate this bad with bland action could be the final nail in the coffin. Fortunately, Del Toro elicits such good performances from the rest of the cast that the acting, on the whole, is quite good. Put together with great visuals, there is still a lot to like about Hellboy and that is likely why it has remained so popular."", ""Given scope and purpose, Hellboy feels tremendous in the first half. Unfortunately, it gives way to the hero's journey trappings of its story, which makes it nothing more than yet another superhero movie. Fortunately, the acting is so good and Del Toro is so talented, Hellboy still manages to be a riveting and truly engaging superhero movie that shows off just what can happen when talented people make a superhero movie.

However, the brilliance of Cold Mountain is not just skin deep, as its epic sweep all encompasses a tremendous romance amidst the Civil War and, in this, the film also discusses the impact of the war on the South and the loss suffered by those at home. Plus, though not strictly a war film (it is, but it is not the film's main focus), Cold Mountain also offers brilliant battle sequences to go along with every other positive offered by the film."", """", ""Cold Mountain is a film some have compared to Homer's the Odyssey in structure. This is certainly fair as the film tells the story of W.P. Inman (Jude Law) and his journey to return home to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) during the Civil War. Suffering injuries, escaping those who will capture deserters, and crossing paths with a collection of individuals, Inman's journey is long and arduous. Among the tremendous cast that cross paths with Inman and Ada include Renee Zellweger, Eileen Atkins, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Charlie Hunnam, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Donald Sutherland, Cillian Murphy, Jack White, Ray Winstone, Taryn Manning, Emily Deschanel, and Jena Malone. Essentially, this cast is stacked. Every supporting character is played by somebody who eventually blew up, was a veteran actor, or was a relatively fresh face in acting. How they managed to get such a good cast together is mind blowing."", """", ""The film's main focus - the romance between Inman and Ada - is tremendously written by Minghella. Each line is precise and chosen well. The end result is a romance that, though the characters rarely share the screen with one another, is incredibly well-crafted and realistic. Though they barely know one another, their connection to one another is beautifully brought to life through the words of Minghella that breathes air into the lungs of the film. Even when things slow down (and they do slow down) and the film drags, the romance here keeps the film chugging along and taking on all challengers."", """", ""Visually, the film is stunning. From shots, such as Inman staggering to Ada alongside two towering snow-covered rocks, to the battle sequences, the cinematography of this film is terrific. The best part here is the framing, especially in that aforementioned shot. The result of shots such as this is a film that feels as poetic visually as it is verbally. Minghella clearly expended a lot of time focusing on his word choice in writing this film and it shows in the sweeping, verbose communication in the film. However, the visuals are the same way. The film's shots match its beauty step-for-step and often exceed it with a willingness to just slow things down and let the odd, romantic beauty of the war in the South soak in for the audience."", """", ""The battle sequences express this same beauty, especially the opening one when the Union bombs the Confederacy. The billowing tower of smoke and fire, as well as the ensuing battle that occurs in a cloud of dust and blood is pure eye candy. Minghella's camera lingers in this sequence quite often, offering a sort of juxtaposition between the beauty of the shot and the brutality of the war. Nobody was spared in battle and, as a result, nobody was spared at home. In this film, Minghella does not waste any violence. Though often brutal, his film is about bringing to light the suffering of those in war and those at home. Given that many war films focus solely on those in battle, this is a breathe of fresh air for the genre. In this goal, Cold Mountain is entirely successful, particularly in the sequence with Sara (Portman). A single mother with a baby who briefly takes in Inman on his journey home, she asks Inman to simply lay next to her in bed where she begins openly weeping. The specific pain and suffering experienced by those at home is obviously spoken about openly in the film, but never described verbally. Rather, it is always told visually with one slight written hints. This is one of the greatest accomplishments of the film, as it manages to delve in this often overlooked topic and offer great insight, without having to stand by and attempt to explain the pain. Instead, it makes it more realistic and intimate by simply showing it to you."", """", ""A brutal, beautiful, and truly sweeping epic, Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain covers the Civil War like few films before it had. Covering battle, romance, and the life of those in South, the film plays no favorites, shows the good and bad of both sides, and covers its topics with grace and ease."" ]";5

In addition, the omages to samurai and spaghetti westerns is perfectly done (and is almost done comedically too). In addition, this film does a better job than the first at providing depth to the characters and figuring out events that we simply saw glimpses of in Volume 1. The acting is also really good, especially Thurman and David Carradine. Michael Madsen also turned in a solid supporting role. However, the best thing this film provides is entertainment.

Personally, I loved it. Though brutal, the film showcases Mel Gibson brilliantly using extreme violence to provide visual evidence of pain and suffering that sin brings. The prolonged scenes of torture were obviously a little much, but further exemplified this suffering and the price Christ paid for us to have salvation. Where The Passion of the Christ overcomes this extreme violence is in its portrayal of Jesus. Easily the best portrayal of Jesus that I have ever seen, Jim Caviezel was brilliant. The dialogue for Christ was on point, as was Caviezel's delivery and, to me, mannerisms. I was frequently almost moved to tears as I watched Caviezel's Jesus truly exemplify what I believe Jesus to be. Additionally, though she had no dialogue, Rosalinda Celentano was brilliant. A menacing and evil presence, she captured the true visual essence of Satan and every time she was around, it sent chills down your spine. Now, I should mention that the film is unabashedly anti-semitic. While a drawback, this is not something that deterred me from truly enjoying this film, though I am unsure that I ever want to watch it again."" ]";5
1330;the-company;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""One of the last films of his career finds director Robert Altman at his most stubborn. Often times, his films are criticized for not really having a plot. Instead, those films are character-driven. It is about the interactions some protagonist has with others and the situations they find themselves in that drive the film forward. Films such as California Split are admittedly quite plotless, but the interactions between the two protagonists on their gambling journey is what propels the film forward. Others, such as McCabe & Mrs. Miller, do have more of a plot, but still rely on the characters to move the film forward. The Company, however, is different. Altman refuses to give us characters or a plot. Yes, the film does pretend to focus on ballet dancer Ryan (Neve Campbell), her boyfriend Josh (James Franco), or company director Alberto (Malcolm McDowell), but very few scenes exist where they are the stars. Instead, the film is about the company. The group of dancers, their interactions, and the film plays out more like a documentary than a true drama."", ""Introducing us to Ryan and her family for no apparent reason, the half-baked character development is the film's biggest fault. Neve Campbell is fine in the role, but Ryan is hardly worthy of so much attention when the film flat out refuses to take it farther than showing us her family and boyfriend. The film would have turned out far better had they just focused on everybody else and the company as a whole, which it seems to want to do. Perhaps Altman could not get funding unless actual characters were added or something, but regardless, it does hold the film back as it just feels excessive and unnecessary. This could also be a writing issue, but even the writing seems to admit these characters are incredibly dry."", ""That said, the world this film drops you into is absolutely irresistible. Though I am not a dancer nor am I a fan of ballet, the intricacy of the performances on display here and the practice is impeccable. The film feels tense and dramatic with very little effort as you watch people battle it out for roles in a never-ending stream of performances. Merely watching a dancer practice or audition is incredibly tense, even when we have no idea who they are. There is a natural tension to this realistic display put forth by Altman's film that really elevates the film. But, the film is not nearly just the drama. It is also the interactions and camaraderie between those in the company. One woman \""rents\"" out her place for fellow dancers and, one night, she goes around at night asking if somebody has an extra condom. It feels like an out of place scene in the film if you view it as being about Ryan, since she is not in the place at all. If you view it as merely a film about the company, its dancers, and its productions, it makes a whole lot more sense. It is an oddly charming sequence that shows that all of these people are in it together, with no questions asked. Though their families may not support them, the other dancers are ride or die."", ""While perhaps not the most engaging film on the surface, there is a lot to like about The Company. It may be Altman's least structured film, or at least one of them, but features a lot of late career flair that his earlier films (1980s) sometimes lacked. He is open to giving up scenes to just the choreography and letting the nameless dancers do their thing, which is to the film's benefit. It is a film about the ballet company and by the ballet company. Altman lets them do the talking, unfortunately the film does try to force Ryan and her dull boyfriend upon us, which is the film's main weakness. The film is about the company. Do not try and add some useless love interest and back story to a film that does not need either. Unfortunately, it did and we are left with a film that feels unfocused as a result of this divided approach between Ryan's story and then everybody else. This division is what holds the film back from being better, but even, it is a terrific odd little film that is not really slice of life or stream of consciousness, but more of a docudrama."" ]";5

Christina Ricci's performance here is also quite strong, though she does get overshadowed by Theron's towering performance. As with many biopics, this one struggles to drum up enough drama to keep you interested, though it managed to always remain something that was intriguing to watch unfold. Ultimately, there is just not much to say about this one. For the most part, it is your usual biopic, except this time it is about a serial killer. The film does many things well, but none of it is great, except for Theron's performance, which really makes the film. There is nothing I can really point to that I did not enjoy here, I just did not love any of it. As a whole, Monster is a pretty good little film that packs a powerful performance from Charlize Theron."" ]";5

The acting, directing, and cinematography, are all pitch perfect and the storytelling here works very well. It is a great example of world cinema since it is a Brazilian film and a great example of how it does not matter what language a film is in, as long as it is very good and this one certainly fits that bill.

What this one did really well is instill the dark mood as loss in many different ways acts like a fog that covers the entire film. Overall, the story is really interesting. On the surface, it is simply a crime thriller where they try to find out who did it and what not, but it is also a representation of human suffering and tragedy. In many ways, it shows how these three troubled boys are not unscathed by the things that have happened to them and how all of them have suffered and will suffer profound losses that consume them entirely. I think the script by Brian Helgeland was fantastic and the direction from Clint Eastwood was really good as well. However, the real star is Sean Penn. I thought Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon were pretty good in their roles here, but Sean Penn stole the entire show. His performance was absolutely marvelous and he really drew you into him, which makes his role in the film all the more believable. It is not surprise that he won for Best Actor."", """", ""In terms of complaints, I see a lot of user reviews calling this one boring and slow, ham-handed, pretentious, and predictable. The only one I can sort of agree with is predictable, though I did not figure it out until the people in the film did (well, part of it, I figured out one part of it early on, but I think we were supposed to). Plus, I do not have a problem with predictability. In addition, this one was anything but boring. It is slow, yes, but it was a perfect showcase of acting and script-driven film. The intensity and sadness of this one were also top-notch and really helped quell any boredom that may set in. As for it being ham-handed or pretentious, no.

The direction from Martin Campbell is assured and he sets the pace perfectly and really is in control of this film.

In terms of acting, Viggo Mortensen is great, as are Ed Harris and Maria Bello. The only actor whose performance was iffy was Ashton Holmes as Mortensen's son. He struggles at times, especially when on screen with heavyweights like Mortensen and Harris. In addition, the film is filled with tension. The film may be a slow burner and all, but once it kicks into high gear, things are very interesting thanks to these very well developed characters and their interpersonal relationships. While at the end of the day, this is a movie, everything felt very authentic and you really believed these people were who they said they were thanks to great writing, acting, and direction. The film has a smalltown feel as well, which is awesome. The violence is a tad graphic, but it never feels like it is too much, which is also a big plus for me personally.

For all of the films obvious shortcomings across the board, it is an incredibly well made and well crafted action film that sets the stakes, sticks to its rules, and comes up with unique and compelling ways to overcome the problems it puts before its heroes. Additionally, the creature design here is very nice and well done. Though it is dated in some spots, the aliens still look pretty cool. Heck, there is even some solid horror-esque moments here reminiscent of Alien combined with great references to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, 2001: A Space Odyssey, ET, and a few more that I am blanking on. Above all, Independence Day is simply entertaining. While that is often not enough to get the job done for me, it is here.

1337;3-women;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Starting off as a psychological drama with themes of obsession, 3 Women hooks towards psychological horror by the end of its second act before turning into a thoroughly confusing film in its third act. Considering themes of motherhood and identity, 3 Women is a deeply philosophical film that borders on incomprehensible plot-wise. Director Robert Altman may be known for plotless films, but this work is more akin to one by Jean-Luc Godard with the general resentment it has for those who try to follow a plot. Whenever it seems as though the film is able to settle in and begin being a truly cohesive work, it takes a dramatic turn and becomes a wholly different experience. In many ways, this film about three women is three films trapped inside of one body, which makes some odd thematic sense."", ""Conceived in a dream by Altman, 3 Women's psychedelic imagery is hardly its only indicator that it was once a dream. Its general elusiveness and the fashion in which its images escape the mind with equal parts subtle tranquility and frustration, 3 Women is a film that defies definition. Introducing us to Millie (Shelley Duvall) and Pinkie (Sissy Spacek), the film begins with them both working at a rehab clinic for geriatric patients. Pinkie is new so Millie is tasked with showing her the ropes. Soon, they become roommates after Millie's roommate moves in with her boyfriend. Pinkie's odd obsession with Millie is immediate. When Millie misses one day of work, Pinkie asks every other nurse at the clinic about her and keeps repeating that she found her to be incredibly nice. Yet, it is clear nobody agrees. Millie has people she hangs around with, but no friends. She sleeps with men, but that is mostly just because she will, not because the men want to sleep with her specifically. In this opening third of the film, Millie shown to be disliked by most and gratingly annoying to the point that nobody listens to her. Simultaneously, she blames Pinkie for all of her flaws. When her old roommate and some guys cancel plans with Millie (which they had thought was \""just drinks\"", while Millie thought it was a \""dinner party\""), she blames Pinkie for this. This section of the film sets the ground work for many themes to be developed later on in the film. Firstly, the concept of identity. Pinkie and Millie are both named Mildred, but Pinkie hates the name. At work, Pinkie accidentally punches Millie's time card. After staining one of her clothes, Pinkie just takes one of Millie's shirts. This manifests itself by the end of the film where it is shown that Pinkie had used Millie's social security number on her W-4 at work. The two of them have practically become the twin co-workers they have by this point. The two are linked and not just in their names. The two have reached the point where Millie speaks on Pinkie's behalf at work and where a man such as Edgar (Robert Fortier) wants to sleep with both of them. They are a package deal and two-of-a-kind, unable to be separated."", ""Yet, after Pinkie takes a nosedive off the balcony into the pool, the film shows identity in a different fashion. Not recognizing her parents (who are the weirdest people ever and about 105 years old, compared to Spacek who looks like she just hit 12), Pinkie goes on to want to be called Millie and embracing her name of Mildred. Earlier, Millie (original Millie) had similarly expressed issues with her parents by saying that she had a dream where her mother had brought her tomatoes, which she hates. Ironically, Pinkie also says she hates tomatoes. Regardless, the two flip after Pinkie's accident. Instead of Millie treating Pinkie poorly, the opposite is now true. Pinkie is even celebrated and beloved by the other members of the apartment complex. She is a real star in the place compared to Millie who is still ignored. Edgar, who first wanted to sleep with Millie, is now sleeping with Pinkie. Their worlds have flipped and the two are at complete odds with one another. Not having the best relationships with their mothers - a major theme that would be more realized in the third act - the two begin to show how identity changes rapidly. Millie is largely the same, but far more sheepish. She takes one stand at work, but bends over backwards for Pinkie despite the abuse. She acts like a mother rejected by her annoying bubblegum-popping teenager. Pinkie's u-turn in the aftermath of her concussion and amnesia begins to reflect the fractured nature of her mind and the film as a whole. Before transitioning into an out-of-left-field conclusion, the film shows Pinkie lying in bed with psychedelic imagery playing over her. Representing the dream-like nature of the whole film, it also hints at the way in which things blend and change at a shocking rate to the point that what once was is hardly incomprehensible and what is now is the only thing that makes sense."" ]";5

A \""cooler\"" for the Shangri-La casino, Bernie's luck begins to turn around when he meets Natalie (Maria Bello). However, drama arises when it becomes clear that Bernie's cruel, old-school mobster and casino head Shelly (Alec Baldwin) will not let this change of fate happen for Bernie. A character study, The Cooler is a pretty down-to-earth film with nothing extravagant about it and it is a worthy film in this area, but the ending feels far too happy for the subject matter."", ""In a typically great performance, Macy plays the unlucky and deeply depressed Bernie incredibly well. Emoting the change of fate due to the addition of Natalie to his life, Macy really brings life to the character throughout and does a great job creating sympathy for this sad soul. Through dialogue and small visual cues (such as the cream in the coffee), director Wayne Kramer expertly highlights the difference in Bernie and his aura that surrounds him. At the beginning, when he came on screen, the screen itself felt cold and unwelcoming. By the end, it had a certain warmth and level of comfort that was discovered by Bernie in his scenes with Natalie. Yet, the best part of this movie is Alec Baldwin. Hands down. He did not get a Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination for this role for no reason. Cold, calculating, yet alone, outmatched, and much like a lion being left for dead by his pride, Baldwin is a brutal, yet oddly sympathetic figure at times. Playing this dichotomy very well, Baldwin somehow elicits compassion from the audience despite the horrible actions he partakes in as a mobster and casino owner. By the end, we realize he acts out of pain and desperation in order to keep his control and really becomes a tragic figure by the end. His horrible actions are still inexcusable, such as his abuse of Natalie, but he is a far more complicated figure than one might expect and Baldwin excels in this role here."", ""Unfortunately this character study, while engaging, is undone by a silly happy ending. Though the film feels as though it spiraling towards a certain conclusion that would fit with the trajectory of its tragic figures, it cops out at the end and opts to give us a lovey dovey conclusion. Not only is it uncharacteristic for the film itself, but it is far too abrupt and, if it needed to be include, should have felt far more seamless and less jarring."", ""The romance between Natalie and Bernie has a loose and natural feeling that helps it blend into the rest of the film. Though a weaker element compared to the scenes in the casino, the romance still largely works, even if it is incredibly contrived and cliche. From being paid to actual love to trying to run away, the romance in The Cooler may work because of some odd chemistry between Macy and Bello, but it is hardly worthy of the focus it receives in the film as a whole. It is a shame that we did not get more of the relationship between Bernie and Shelly, in particular the issues regarding the casino and its future. There is far more meat on those bones, than in the scenes of romance. While largely well crafted, it is not due to originality or intrigue, but merely rides on the talent of its actors."", ""A low-key character study, The Cooler is a finely paced and compelling story set in Las Vegas. Graced with the a mystical feeling, The Cooler develops terrific characters, but a cliche romance element and a jarring ending hold the film back from being anything but above average to pretty good.

Though often giving way to cliche, particularly with 11-year old Sam running through the airport to find the \""love of his life\"", Love Actually manages to rise above the cliches by somehow exploiting them perfectly.

Though given relatively little screentime, their quick chemistry and immediate romantic charm make them an enjoyable couple to watch progress during the film. This duo really shows the charm of the film and how effective it can be at drawing pathos. We barely see this duo and yet, their encounters are entirely memorable and incredibly well handled."", ""Love Actually's willingness to embrace cliche may be its biggest turn off for many, but for myself, it was one of the best pieces. On their own, each story would certainly crumble if extended into a whole film. Together, however, they soar as little snippets into a variety of people's love lives. As a whole, it is a vignette and love letter to love and all of its ills and joys."", ""Now, Love Actually is imperfect. By not focusing on any single character, it does limit itself somewhat. Though a great vignette into love as a whole, one of the best parts of any romance film is being along for the whole ride. By jumping from character-to-character, Love Actually deprives its audience of this element and, as a result, the climax is not as infectious as it could have been. Still a great climax, but a bit stunted compared to the others works by Curtis."", ""Love Actually is a bold and ambitious look at love by director Richard Curtis. Pairing him with a tremendous and large cast, the film is a beautiful take on the matter and really delves into all that it can bring. That said, its large cast and numerous characters, though well-written, can be both a gift and a curse given the genre of the film.

The writing and direction from Billy Ray are both great and make for a fantastic film, but as I said, the real success here is the acting. Peter Sarsgaard steals the spotlight from the title character throughout with a fantastic performance as Chuck Lane, the new editor at The New Republic. However, Hayden Christensen is still phenomenal as Stephen Glass, while Chloe Sevigny, Steve Zahn, and Hank Azaria, are also all really good here. Billy Ray's debut feature, Shattered Glass is better than his follow-up to it, Breach, solely because this one never feels boring. Sure, the length helps with that, but it always manages to entertain, inform, and be an overall great watch. A very good film with A+ acting, Shattered Glass tells a cautionary tale about the loopholes that can be found in journalism."" ]";5

Maybe my tastes have simply just changed in that time, but wow, this was awesome. Billy Crudup is stellar, as are Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Marion Cotillard, and Jessica Lange. A fantastical adventure through the stories told to a man by his now dying father, Big Fish is a touching film that should strike a chord with every man in some way, in terms of his relationship with his father. This film is very much imperfect. The story could have told better for sure and the film can be a bit distant at times, but none of that matters because Big Fish touches you in a way that many films cannot. An imaginative film that is very much about the men it concerns more so than the stories told here, Big Fish is a winner because of the heart at its core, more so than the stories it told that may not make much sense and could have been told better. After a while, the tall tales told here become entirely endearing, which is just too darn appropriate."" ]";5

There are some small complaints I have with the action sequences though, but I will return to those. The sets are costumes are also beautifully put together. Overall, this film has a lot going for it. Now, none of those truly make it a great film, however. For the negatives, the action sequences, while brilliant, can be a bit confusing at times. They are so action-packed and intense, it can be hard to identify who is who due to the frenetic pace during the sequences. The dialogue, while fine, can be hard to hear sometimes. I had the volume at a perfect level for everything, but then somebody would mumble their dialogue, so I wound up missing small bits and pieces, which is annoying. I should not have to have subtitles on to hear some pieces of dialogue. Finally, the film has some unnecessary parts that did not really further anything. Without them, the final product would be a lot tighter and sharper, rather than spending time showing things that do not really further the plot at all.

If you hear that this is an epic action film about samurais with Tom Cruise, you could probably take a very solid guess about what will happen and how it will happen. However, in spite of that, The Last Samurai never fails to entertain for many reasons. For one, director Edward Zwick is underappreciated massively by critics, as he honestly has a ton of talent, especially when it comes to directing films of this type that revolve around their battle sequences. The battle sequences are brilliantly directed, filmed, and choreographed. In addition, the costume design is great and entirely authentic. The interactions between the Emperor, Cruise, and the Samurai, are also all entirely endearing and moving. Tom Cruise and, especially, Ken Watanabe are also fantastic here and truly command the screen. They have great chemistry and really work well together when they share the screen. Finally, it never overdoes it with the action. While this is an action-packed film, it is just as much as about the characters it portrays and the historical elements it tries to factor in as it is about the action. Overall, The Last Samurai is an entertaining love letter to the days where the Samurai reigned supreme in Japan and is a winner in my books."" ]";5

A poetic and stirring look at death with truly breathtaking performances from Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, and Benicio del Toro, this film brought me to tears so many times, I lost count. The non-linear narrative can be a bit of a challenge, but when you see the whole thing, the power of it all truly brings you to your knees. The characters are brilliantly developed and express emotions and pain the way a real person would. Their writing is so strong that their pain becomes your pain as the film invokes a consistent feeling of empathy for all three of the characters, regardless of their transgressions and personal faults. 21 Grams is a stunning work that will leave you in ruins."" ]";5

Well-written and directed by Linklater, School of Rock also has a good performance from Joan Cusack and very impressive performances from the young kids who show tons of potential in this film. The main drawback is that some of the scenes are really hard to watch due to how uncomfortably awkward they are, but hey, that's just me.

This one is called a comedy drama, but it was never really that funny, so it missed the mark there, but the drama was well done. The characters were all very well developed and you really feel like you know them all by the end of the film.

From the point of the twist being introduced, the film is incredibly engrossing and suspensful. Prior, it is implausible (after the twist is still implausible as well) and, honestly, rather silly. On top of this, I am not a huge fan of John Cusack in general and this one is no exception as his performance is sub-par, however, he is not the one to turn in the worst performance, rather that title goes to Dustin Hoffman. For Hoffman, this one feels entirely mailed in and his Louisiana accent is poor at best and feels very unnatural. Or, at least, I think he was trying for an accent. The only performance worth mentioning in terms of being good is Rachel Weisz' turn. She was really good in this and really was head and shoulders better than everyone else.

On the negative side of things, the dialogue can become a tad cheesy at times and make you roll your eyes that they decided to go with that line. On top of that, the violence, while stylish, can be numbing and the death scenes repeat themselves (i.e. many characters die in the same exact way and you see a similar shot of their death). Finally, the weird anime sequence as we got a character's back story was a turn off for me. It just made the film feel disjointed and felt like a very weird turn that was not really necessary."", """", ""Overall, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a pretty good film. However, as it is simply half of the final product, it does feel unfinished, so you have to take the fact that it is intended to be the first half of the film into account, which is why I do like this one as much as I do.

Stuffy, proper, and decidedly odd and ritualistic, Eastwood captures the essence of the South throughout the film. From large and old plantation homes, Confederate flags in the courtroom, a Confederate flag on Jude Law's arm, a love of firearms, and an eclectic group of people that could rival Hollywood for the number of weirdos, the south is odd and Eastwood knows it. Odd is not bad. It is just odd and this film captures that essence throughout the film with the constant belief that something is just off with everything as a whole. This really lends itself to a mystery film, even if Eastwood indulges far too often in the oddities of this town. Other signs of bloating - a romance angle that was not in the book - do hold this film back, but with terrific acting, the aforementioned atmosphere, and a compelling story, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a pretty good crime mystery."", ""Divisive upon release, there was one element that nobody disagreed on: Kevin Spacey and John Cusack are brilliant. As a reporter, John Kelso, sent to cover the party of a Southern big shot for Town & Country Magazine, John Cusack is terrific. Honestly, is there a better audience surrogate than Cusack? Personable and charismatic, but never unattainable, he is perfect for this role and allows the audience to really feel the Southern regality and weirdness. Navigating the cultural minefield of the conservative but eccentric Savannah, Georgia, Cusack's reporter is smart and well crafted. He embraces the town and it embraces him back, but he never loses sight of why he is there: Jim Williams. Befriending the rich Williams and sticking around after he is charged with murdering Billy Hanson (Jude Law), Kelso works alongside Williams' legal team to help his defense, but also writes a book on his experiences in the process."", ""As the charged Williams, Spacey really shows adds this as another string to his bow in the late 1990s. In Se7en, The Usual Suspects, LA Confidential, and American Beauty, Spacey forever cemented his status as a legend. Terrifying, menacing, yet eminently human, he is a great actor who finally gets his due once more on House of Cards. Yet, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil often feels like a precursor to that television series. Playing a rich Southern bachelor who certainly is gayer than he can let on in the Bible belt, Williams is a tricky figure. Manipulative, cordial, warm, but with a soul as black as coal, Williams is a dark figure masquerading as a figure of good. He is evil, but tries to operate in the garden of good. This is largely highlighted in a scene with the voodoo lady of Savannah. Doing some weird voodoo ritual to help him beat the charge, Williams speaks positively of Billy right before midnight (the time for good), but then vows to never ask Billy for forgiveness after midnight (the time for bad). Though he claims it was self-defense, the film certainly seems to hint it was anything but and there were likely other motivations for killing Billy than self-defense. Regardless, Spacey plays the role tremendously."", ""Plot-wise, the film really engages the audience. Refusing to divulge the cards up its sleeves, Eastwood's film grabs you and makes you follow all of the moving pieces. It is one that does not offer resolutions because it is based on a real story. Real life is messy and incomplete, which is the case with this film. While the court case is decided, it does not decide the truth and, in fact, the truth remains unclear. Personally, I would argue that Jim killed Billy, his gay lover, in cold blood. Billy likely either wanted to leave him or go public with their arrangement and, well, the rich Jim could not have that. Yet, that said, coming to a conclusion all your own is part of the joy of this film and something that Eastwood captured well."", ""That said, at two-and-a-half hours, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is long. There are one too many adventures with the Lady Chablis and the unnecessary addition of a romantic interest for John Kelso distract Eastwood and his film from reaching its conclusion. At its core, it is a story about a murder in a Southern Gothic and old school city with old school values. Though eccentric, them acquitting a gay man is unheard of, which makes the case itself very compelling. Will they convict a rich man because he is gay or acquit a gay man because he is rich? Yet, Eastwood indulges in the boisterous and infectious energy of the Lady Chablis too often. She is fun and a great character, but does not tie into the murder at all. She testifies, but her testimony adds nothing. She adds entertainment alone and, as such, diverts from the purpose of the film. Similarly, Mandy (Alison Eastwood) adds nothing and her addition feels like nepotism."" ]";5

The script and story are both very good and the visual effects are brilliantly put together and gorgeous.  The acting here is also good, in particular from Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, and William Fichtner. The message here is also a good one, as it essentially argues that science and religion are not mutually exclusive and can work together, rather than against one another. You can also see the influence of 2001: A Space Odyssey here for sure, as well as the influence of Close Encounters of the Third Kind in the way the possibility of aliens is handled.

Open Range does a good job establishing its characters, their motivations, and setting the stage for its big shootout.

It is intriguing, sexual, and really takes you for a loop throughout as you watch the plot unfold and finally figure out what is going on. In regards to that, this one is very, very well-written. The plot is complex and dense, but not too complex and really keeps you guessing throughout. The characters are fleshed out and really are a case of some serious foreshadowing cluing you into what is happening. The direction from Lawrence Kasdan is great and the attention to detail paid to the lighting, shots, and entire mise en scene is insane.

Underworld certainly fits that bill and really started this trend for Beckinsale. In this film, she is a vampire who kills lycans (werewolves) for a living, as part of the long war between the two factions. Directed by Beckinsale's husband as of 2004, Len Wiseman, and co-starring her partner as of 2003, Michael Sheen, Underworld is cited as the film where she left Sheen for Wiseman. Oddly enough, she was the one who wanted Sheen to be cast in the film. Awkward. That aside, however, Underworld is a thoroughly entertaining fantasy shoot 'em up with great mythology and stylish action sequences that make up for its lesser elements."", ""With great mythology and background to the issues afflicting the vampires and the werewolves in this world, Underworld really takes its time and develops the hatred. Throughout, the film manages to nimbly switch between the two sides and have the audience develop sympathy for both sides. As many critics cited upon its release in 2003, this is really the film's greatest asset. Its success with it is up for debate, but what is not up for debate is the depth and scope of its mythology and how truly intriguing it shapes up to be. By the end of the film, it truly becomes a shame that all of the sequels are seen as being so bad, because spending more time in this world would be a truly captivating exercise."", ""Another strength here is the action. The whole film is seemingly shot through a blue filter, which is actually quite appealing and really does work with these action sequences. Cited as a rip-off of The Matrix by some for its use of trenchcoats and slow motion action scenes, Underworld's action is hardly attractive. It is also quite nonsensical with endless magazines and shootouts in public that hit nobody. This does not mean it is not slick as all get out, however. Very well shot and quite visually appealing, the action's style really hides up its blemishes nicely. In particular, there is a scene where Selene (Kate Beckinsale) spins around and shoots out the floor around her to create a hole in the floor, allowing her to drop down to the next floor. Obviously, this is very stupid. Yet, it does look very good."", ""In terms of acting, it can be quite hammy. However, who does not want to see Beckinsale, Michael Sheen, and Bill Nighy, ham it up? Plus, their characters are actually quite good, allowing them to have a lot to chew on in the roles. In particular, the character of Viktor, played by Nighy, is great. An elder vampire who is awoken by Selene upon the discovery of a conspiracy within their midst, Viktor is a towering figure. Instilling terror and fear wherever he goes, Viktor is a truly menacing vampire and Nighy captures this terrifically. Sheen was also very good in his role as Lucien, a werewolf. The leader of the werewolves, Sheen is both strict, tyrannical, and highly sympathetic in his role, especially once we begin to learn more-and-more about him. Quite well-written, Sheen really makes the most of the role from an emotional standpoint."", ""On the negative, Underworld is simply absurd. As mentioned before, it is quite fantastical with a lot of action movie cliches. With missed shots abounding, the film's mythology saves it from becoming just a run-of-the-mill action movie, but that does mean the film does not still come close to being the furthest thing from original. It compounds this problem with a terrible romance element between Selene and Michael (Scott Speedman). Unconvincing and greatly rushed, the romance merely distracts from the plot, rather than helping advance it. For many Hollywood action movies, this is a problem and it is certainly one in Underworld."", ""Entertaining and easy to digest, Underworld is hardly the most challenging film ever released.

On the positive side, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are phenomenal and their chemistry is great. It is amazing to believe that Johansson was 17 at the time that this one was filmed. The cinematography of the film is also gorgeous. Sofia Coppola picked a great location for this one in Japan and really maximized its potential with the look of the film. In addition, as the two become closer-and-closer, but have obvious things preventing them from being together (both being married for starters), it is a charming film that shows how the best things in life can be unplanned and completely unexpected. The way in which their relationships with their spouses, or lack thereof, is also very well done. The amount of development that happens there and with the characters themselves in the short time frame of the film is impressive.  For a romantic film, it was never mushy or fake, rather it felt completely genuine and natural, while also being funny at times to lighten the mood."", """", ""On the negative side of things, this one certainly is not a loveletter to marriage. Rather, it feels as if the film's goal is to argue against marriage at times as both people deal with unhappy marriages. As they move closer together, the fact that they are married to other people is a disturbing element for me. There are many things that could keep them apart (age being a major one) that would keep that \""we want to be together but can't be\"" element alive, so I did not enjoy that Coppola chose marriage as the thing that keeps them apart. In addition, the age difference is a tad creepy. Murray is over 50 here and Johansson is 17. The fact that they are forming this type of relationship is a tad off-putting. The same effect could have been created with a younger actor instead of Murray or an older one instead of Johansson. Finally, the criticism the film has faced for its portrayal of the Japanese is fair. The portrayal is there to exaggerate the differences between the two protagonists and the culture that surrounds them, but it feels more mocking and offensive than simply showing how their culture is different from ours."" ]";5

Until then, it was a good western, but one with far too many sequences of somebody just staring off into the distance and then looking back, only to look off into the desert again. By the halfway point though, something changed. It clicked. This staring became brilliant. The scenes of action well earned and brilliantly executed. It is a pitch perfect western and was the very embodiment of what the genre is and was capable of becoming. With a terrific score, great acting, and brilliant direction, Once Upon a Time in the West is a tremendous film."", ""A story concocted by Leone, Dario Argento, and Bernardo Bertolucci, will hardly ever turn out poorly and Once Upon a Time in the West shows why. Its story - a man and his family with a land settlement are killed by a ruthless man. His widow is left with the land, which is apparently quite valuable as the railroad is set to come through the acreage and her husband planned on building a town surrounding it, having already purchased the materials. It is the perfect settlement and the criminals of the wild west know the score. In its relatively simplistic plotting, the film is clearly influential on a variety of westerns, such as Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller or Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider. Both revisionist westerns, the films show upstart towns with unexpected value. Altman's film shows a frontierman who marries a prostitute (just like in this film), who meets his demise after his town becomes the target of men who wish to control the whole area. Pale Rider has a similar set-up, but with gold under the settlement. A variety of westerns have had this set-up, but both of those feel cut from the same contemplative and methodically paced cloth as Leone's film."", ""Direction-wise, the film is pitch perfect. Terrific staging of each sequence, a largely tight plot, and beautiful imagery adorn this film. For a film so slow and long, it never bores. There is significant power in the random close-ups of the film and it is because of the direction of Leone. The film is engaging due to the varied approach to the gun battles and characterizations in the film, with each sequence having characters hiding in signs or shadows, creating a great sense of mystery and originality each time a man brandishes a gun. Additionally, each character wears their personality on their sleeve. Every drop of this film is precise and included for a reason, even if the film is not dealing with overly complex themes or anything. It is simply a tight, straight forward western that hums along at its own pace. One of the strongest parts of this film, however, is the score from Ennio Morricone. At a certain point, the men all look the same. They are tanned white guys with beards. It is hard to tell them apart. Morricone's score helps. It serves as an introduction to who they are, what to expect from the scene, and it cultivates atmosphere. Numerous scenes ride on the sense of mystery instilled by Morricone's score that keeps the viewer alert to the fact that something is off or that something is about to happen. The score not only serves for dramatic impact and as an extension of the characterization, but it is also quite sonically pleasing with Morricone's classic western chords coming to play throughout the film and really creating the perfect ambiance for this film. There is not a note that goes wrong with every chord and line coming off beautifully and helping to created a full figured beauty of a film."", ""A classic and masterpiece, Once Upon a Time in the West is a film that I should have seen long ago, but I am glad to have encountered it now because I was finally ready to let Leone into my life as the master that he was. Brilliantly scored, directed, and paced, the film may be long, but its preciseness and terrific technical and visual elements sink their hooks into you with ease and never let go until the film ends. Of the 1960s westerns from Leone, this one certainly ranks as the strongest and with great reason. This is a film that soars on its unpredictability and originality, constantly keeping the audience guessing as to how everything will turn out due to both the plotting and staging of the film and its shootouts. This is not just some simple shoot 'em up western. This is a film with violence and shootouts that advance the plot and serve a purpose, which give them significant stakes and power.

Surreal, dark, and defying interpretation, Naked Lunch is a nut that is not just tough to crack, but it fights back. It is a film that, naively, I believed I had pinned down as we neared the ending. However, the one thing the film left me with, above all else, is to exterminate rational thought. To approach this one rationally is to approach it wrong.

Every odd encounter is merely part of the writing process and the path his brain takes in order to spit out this novel of his. These visualizations and alternate reality are merely the high given to him by writing and living on the literary edge. Thus, he is addicted to writing and the high he receives from the written word. His world and the film itself is autobiographical of Burroughs beyond the similar life details. Rather, this is his world. Accentuated by drug use, Naked Lunch is the mind of a writer given to other writer's to let them know they are not crazy. Writing is a mad science to a degree and this film articulates the intricacies and oddities that the mind goes through when writing. In essence, writing is a drug that grants you a passport to an alternate reality. Yet, it is a bug that refuses to be exterminated and an itch that simply must be scratched."", ""To expose his story, in Naked Lunch this is Interzone, a writer must go undercover. Yet, he can lose sight of himself and begin to believe in his own cover story. By doing this, he loses sight of reality and of who he actually is in the real world. The fake story, Interzone, is one that he merely experiences and delves into when he needs to write. William realizes that he is losing sight of reality in the film when he cries on the ground after saying goodbye to two friends, fearful that he will never see them again. This fear comes from the knowledge that he is losing sight of reality. The high and power given to him through storytelling is one that makes the real world feel like a poor imitation of the reality he has carved for himself by himself. This is why the writers here are obsessed with their typewriters. It is their needle. Their vial. The instrument used to make them feel real and enter reality once more. As such, it is addictive."", ""The film itself, while defying rational thought, it is also about the extermination of rational thought. Writing enters us into a world of fiction. It defies rational thought and can be surreal. It can depict reality according to the artist. This ties together two scenes in the film. One, the opening where William's two friends are speaking about writing. One argues that rewriting is a must, while the other says it is a sin because it betrays your original thoughts. William says then that all rational thought must be exterminated. Later, Tom Frost (Ian Holm) communicates to William without his lips. His lips say something else as his words talk to him about consciousness and the killing of his wife."" ]";5
1362;inside-man;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Overall, Inside Man is a good heist movie with enough negatives to detract from what is truly a really thrilling and entertaining heist. First, the positives. Clive Owen kills it as the bank robber. Really, he and the heist as a whole are what make this film a success. The trickery and deception he employs really make this a fun and entertaining watch. Denzel Washington also has a good turn as the detective, though he certainly takes a back seat to Owen, as well as Jodie Foster who does great in her role as a \""fixer\"". As we watch the events unfold, it is very entertaining to watch the head-to-head battles between the three as they all represent competing interests concerning the heist. Finally, the ending is great as we learn how everything transpired. There are still some things that make no sense, but I will let it slide here."", """", ""On the negative side, as with all Spike Lee films, there are parts where race is shoved down your throat. Luckily, it did not choke the life out of this one, but still felt forced, irrelevant to the storyline, and unnecessary. In addition, the camera work is at times spotty and left me scratching my head and wondering why they chose to use that angle or use that effect, etc. Two scenes in particular (one in which Washington's character runs to the bank doors and one in which Foster's character is patted down by one of the bank robbers) where the camera work is annoying and takes you out of the film entirely."" ]";5

Also, as with the first two, the film watching experience is entirely magical. It really wisks you away to another land and engulfs you in the happenings as if it is happening in your world. It is hard to put my finger on what makes this series so great, but I think we get a taste of it at the end as even when this film, the final in the trilogy, ended I was left wanting more. Over three hours was simply not enough of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Gandalf, etc, for me, which is an amazing thing to say. As for the ending, it is great, though it does go on a tad too long for my liking and is not as great as the rest of the film, but it works and it is pretty satisfying. The Lord of the Rings is one of the rare film franchises that gets better as it goes on, though that is not to say the first two are bad, as they are just as good as this one.

A film about highlighting our similarities in the face of so many differences and animosities, Joyeux Noel is a beautiful film celebrating the kinship of humanity. Telling the real life story of the Christmas truces of 1914 in World War I, Joyeux Noel is a film with great scope, as it focuses on the French, British, and German soldiers in equal measure. With good cinematography, gorgeous music, and an infectious Christmas spirit, Joyeux Noel is an undeniably remarkable work by director Christian Carion."", ""Blending bloodshed with tears, Joyeux Noel's great breadth really both elevates and harms the film. By showcasing the stories of all three sides and their similarities and all of the elements that make them human, the film expertly creates sympathy on all sides. When the bureaucracy shows up to condemn the actions, both in a religious and war sense, it leaves the audience feeling angered. Yet, it does nothing to undo the brotherhood on display beforehand. From shots of the three troops in their own trenches to the three sides meeting in no man's land to celebrate Christmas, the film is well-served by treating all sides equally. There is no bad, only good. In juxtaposition to the words of their superiors, the soldiers at battle know the truth: there is more that unites us than divides. For this, Joyeux Noel is a phenomenal work that serves up a striking and moving message to humanity: drop your arms and join together, forgetting our petty differences, and unite under one umbrella. This message is not restricted to religion either, though it does heavily depict Catholicism. As shown, the Catholic Church rebuked the priest who conducted the Christmas mass for the soldiers. Thus, religion is like nationality. It is merely something that serves to divide us. It is only when we are truly human with no barriers - such as in joining together to celebrate Christmas or burying our dead - do we find unity with one another. However, all of this said, its breadth hurts it in the character development department. With so much going on, names get lost in the shuffle and stories blend together. While the stories are all moving and serve to further unite the characters, it feel all too much for two hours. That said, this is a nitpicky concern, given the power of the togetherness in the film. In fact, it could be argued that by giving little attention to character development, the film is aiming to create a sense of realism. Essentially, we know as much about these characters as they reveal to the opposing sides. By the end, this is numerous and reveals a lot about who they are. However, it is only very little information, but it information with great impact that drives home the point that these are humans with lives and wives who, for all intents and purposes, is the exact same as yourself. Thus, we do not really need more character development because it would create an affiliation for certain characters over others when we should instead feel attached to all of them. This is fair and, obviously, I do agree. However, in a longer film, delving further into some stories on each sides would have been a great addition."", ""However, nothing can match the chills of Anna Sorensen (Diane Kruger) or Private Nicolas Sprink (Benno Furmann) singing for the troops as all sides play the accompanying music. Moving, stirring, and entirely breathtaking to watch, these moments repeatedly gave me chills due to the way in which it truly captures the spirit of Christmas and why this season is the best of the year. One of the few times we all come together, Joyeux Noel is about coming together at all odds. Here, music and a love of God bring the characters together and, even if you hate music or do not believe in God, it is hard to deny the power of the film in these moments."", ""Though called sentimental by some (and it certainly is), Joyeux Noel is a breathtaking and beautiful work about Christmas and what the season truly means. A film about dropping your arms and differences in order to join one another in celebration of the season, Joyeux Noel is a gorgeous work that is wide in scope, but never loses sight of its main purpose: to bring joy."" ]";5

With fun action scenes, banter, and a charismatic turn from Harrison Ford, Temple of Doom may be a lot darker and more violent than even Steven Spielberg liked, but it is still a very campy and fun film that delivers all of the Indiana Jones spills and thrills anticipated courtesy of great action set pieces and his iconic lasso."", ""What is always striking about the Indiana Jones films is that they are both compelling romps through archaeological legends and rip roaring good times nonetheless. While the archaeology is hardly a focus of the films, the mythology always is and Spielberg continuously delivers compelling and fun mythology. Here, the film is set in India with a magic rock missing that is being used by a Kali worshipping occult group that sacrifices people to honor Kali. Sent in to find the magic rocks and put a stop to this group of weirdos, Dr. Jones faces some considerable pushback from this demonic underworld while running about with Asian child sidekick Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) and blonde bimbo Willie (Kate Capshaw). While the film's beats are hardly different from Raiders of the Lost Ark in this prequel, the film's fun energy and blending of this mythology with excellent action set pieces consistently sets this one apart from other dumb blockbusters with half-hearted mythology that never lends itself to the action. Instead, the mythology and legend of the film is always given room to breathe and is always given the time of day instead of being squandered by focusing solely on the action. As a result, it is a blockbuster with a fun and unique plot that has great action instead of a hollow piece of trash that is just action with no substance whatsoever."", ""That is not to say the film is not flawed, nonetheless. While dripping with historical mythology, the film does still get a bit too wrapped up in the action as it reaches the end of the second act. From the point where Indy drinks to the blood to when they get off the bridge, the film barrels full speed towards its climax and falling action with reckless abandon. The set pieces are all very nice, but just become too much to become far too long. While the scenes all serve a purpose, they just go on for far too long and for a non-action junkie, though the scenes are truly excellent pieces of filmmaking, it just felt like Spielberg opted to ditch that aforementioned strength in focusing evenly on action and mythology in the name of just going balls to the wall with action scenes. It is a sadly hollow result, no matter how nice they look (aside from the severely dated special effects on the bridge that are hysterical, especially when that chief demon heart ripper out guy hits the mountain)."", ""The film's flaws continue to its various cultural issues both in the stereotypical comic relief antics of the young Short Round, but perhaps the worst is Willie. A blonde bimbo who worries about breaking her nails, the character smacks of Spielberg having just watched Alien and thinking, \""Ha! Women could never do that.\"" Though he is hardly a misogynistic filmmaker, the character of Willie is certainly one of his worst with her just there to provide cleavage and comedy about how useless women are in \""manly\"" situations. She screams when it will reveal their position, is too weak to get on elephants like young boys can do easily, she freaks out with bugs, and has to be shown how to do literally anything. Oh and she also is just there to flirt with Indy and use suggestive innuendo. Charming character, to say the least. The writing is hardly the reason to see this film, but this piece was just above and beyond terrible."", ""Fun, action-packed, and excellently anchored by Harrison Ford, the Temple of Doom may be a stepback from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it is a good film nonetheless. That said, I do miss everybody from the original film and wish this were not a prequel, even if the Nazis would have needed to be involved in this film (as Spielberg makes it sound, if it were a sequel). Rather offensive to Hindus and women alike, the film is otherwise harmless fun with excellent blockbuster filmmaking by Spielberg with fun and inventive set pieces, smart mythology, and the perfect establishment of stakes to give this one considerable weight. Though imperfect, Temple of Doom is nonetheless another fun Indiana Jones film."" ]";5

The film is also very well directed, even though James Cameron is not sitting in the director's chair for this one.

Robin Williams manages to blend the two things he was great at in this one: being absolutely hilarious, but also just being a great actor. Throughout, the film really pulls on your heart strings and makes you feel invested as you root for Williams' character to be able to see his children. The film is pretty well-written and is relatively well directed, which also help here. My main complaint is that it did get a little ridiculous at times. There were moments that just angered me with how stupid it was and how far-fetched it was. Sure, the premise is a little far-fetched, but not as out there as some of the stuff that happens in the film itself.

The score is also brilliant and the thrills/intrigue are provided quite capably by this one. In addition, the sets are effects are really well done. However, where this one truly excels is in its message. A warning about eugenics, Gattaca is not really a science fiction film or a thriller. Rather, it is an inspirational film as it shows that no matter what people think, you can achieve your dreams if you work hard enough to do so, even if there are things that could/will hold you back. In terms of the science fiction, the futuristic elements and technologies are all really well done and developed, plus all are very interesting ideas that may seem implausible now, but could be fact in just a matter of time. The thriller element was also interesting, but since I do not want to spoil too much, I will not mention what I like about it, but it keeps you on edge as you try to see if the cops will figure everything out or not. Overall, Gattaca is a smart, thrilling film that grabs a hold of you early on and does not let go until the film is over."" ]";5

Luckily, the storyline is also very captivating and hooks you right in as you realize what Mahowny has been doing and how deep he is in the hole that makes him do what he does. The struggles facing this man are perfectly portrayed by Hoffman and the struggles facing his girlfriend are brilliantly and beautifully portrayed by Driver, who is a close second to Hoffman here in terms of performance.

1371;cronos;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Guillermo del Toro has always had a flair for the fantastical and that was ever on display in his directorial debut, Cronos. A vampire film about an unsuspecting man who discovers a device that will give him eternal life, Cronos is a film with considerable heart, but also a terrific atmosphere, special effects, and a knack for making you feel unsettled. Of his works that I have seen, del Toro makes horror-esque films and often dabbled on the outskirts of the horror genre. Cronos is the most horror of any of them, but it is not the type to leave you scared and afraid to turn off the lights. Instead, it is the type of horror film that lingers in the air and in the mind."", """", ""With a compelling premise and well thought out mythology behind this mysterious cronos device, Guillermo del Toro creates a sense of mystery that quickly turns into dread as you discover what secrets this device holds. Creating this stiff, atmospheric tension, del Toro's debut never produces outright scares, but it does create significant tension. As Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi) begins to explore the device and transform before our eyes, the film is incredibly tense and retains this sense of mystery, as the film's mythology and explanation of events is ever evolving as we learn alongside Jesus what this device is truly capable of. The unique backstory aside, however, the film does largely stick to typical vampire genre tropes when it comes to the daily life of a vampire. However, del Toro executes these tropes very well and makes them feel fresh and new, in large part thanks to the backstory."", """", ""In terms of the writing, it is typical del Toro fare. Smart and well crafted characters who are very well developed and relatable. Particularly, del Toro manages to wring significant pathos out of this film, particularly when it comes to the relationships between Jesus and his wife and his granddaughter. Truly moving, this is the human core to all of del Toro's fantastical films and, as he will later do to perfection in Pan's Labyrinth, he executes it flawlessly. This is not some hollow vampire film. Instead, it is one with a heart and soul, which is always appreciated."", """", ""The film's special effects are another one of its major strengths, namely when Jesus is becoming a vampire. The decaying flesh, the ripping of dead flesh, and the full transformation, are really impressive. This is make-up special effects at their very finest and given the film's release date, this work is thoroughly impressive. How they managed to make them look this believable and never silly is a true accomplishment."", """", ""Overall, Cronos is a terrific film that showcases the skill Guillermo del Toro already possessed at the time of his debut, as well as hinted at even better things for the director.

Though the duo rarely share the screen, the moments they do and the moments they do not are filled with the air of being of a classic Hollywood romance. With two well matched leads and the film fully aware of its status as being a far-fetched Hollywood romantic film, Sleepless in Seattle is an irresistibly adorable film that is always entertaining. Striking a balance between grieving, romance, and comedy, it is clear that this film is by a woman, Nora Ephron. With the romance being found in the words, not in the looks, the film is a romantically written depiction of the true meaning of love."", ""In my review of Carol, I discussed the power of a look. In that film, Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara share a look that makes it feel as though time has stopped. The look in their eyes make it appear that all of their questions have been answered. Sleepless in Seattle contains a look of the same quality. With just fleeting moments of Sam (Tom Hanks) and Annie (Meg Ryan) sharing the screen, Ephron casts aside words. Instead, the power of love is found in a look and a touch. From there, magic happens and the romance in the film is cemented as being nothing less than magical."", ""However, equally important are the words. Hearing Sam, grieving from the loss of his wife, on a radio show, Annie is moved to tears by his words about his wife. Ephron's writing captures what women want: a man who loves them. Sam loved his wife and was not ashamed to admit it or tell the whole world about that love. Simple statements such as asking how long he had to explain what he loved most leave Annie and women across the country in a sea of tears. While the film can be a bit sexist as it shows women as being emotional wrecks and men as emotionally distant, it works because these moments are so exquisitely written from a romance standpoint. Ephron does not hide that she is trying to emulate classic 1940s/1950s romance films such as those with Cary Grant with repeated references to An Affair to Remember. Instead, she fully embraces the cheesiness and over-the-top romantic nature of those films. With audacious romantic set pieces such as the Empire State Building, absurd coincidences, and repeated references to fate, Sleepless in Seattle is cheesy as all hell. Fortunately, cheese is often delicious and this film certainly fits that bill with a gooey center that leaves you feeling happy. The dialogue in the film emphasizes that cheese with the characters merely dropping words that women would kill to hear from, apparently, any man."", ""The film's comedy is great, especially the running gag regarding An Affair to Remember. However, as always, Hanks is an able comic with great delivery of his various comedic lines. Ryan receives less comedic lines, but when given the chance, she nails the line. Yet, the biggest fault of the film is its treatment of Walter (Bill Pullman). Though romantic and funny, Walter is cast aside because he commits the cardinal sin of men: being boring. He is boring. He is allergic to everything, sure, but he is also boring. He is safe and hardly exciting. He may love Annie and be engaged to her, but she quickly loses interest purely through hearing Sam. There is no magic between her and Walter. However, the film seems to go out of its way to make you see how boring Walter is, even by picking on his name and serious nature. By the end, when Annie dumps him, he is so boring he just lets her go. He understands and allows her to leave. Walter may be a good guy who does not want to restrict her, even if he loves her, but man is he boring. By the end of the film, Sleepless in Seattle seems to want you to understand that Annie is not a bad person for emotionally cheating on Walter, but we know the truth. Your partner being boring is not an excuse to cheat on them, even if you did not do anything sexually to cheat on them. Just be upfront from the beginning and do not lead them on. The funny part is she was fine with Walter until she sensed a better option being available. Here, the film really struggles and fails to justify putting its leads together."", ""Fortunately, Sleepless in Seattle is a funny, romantic, and subtle piece of 1990s rom-com entertainment. With two well matched leads, the film is a vintage Hollywood romance film, even if it lacks scenes between the lovers and a great kiss finale. Through the lack of these, the film feels oddly authentic, even if its plot is absurd. Yet, Sleepless in Seattle is able to find realism by capturing the look, feel, and sound of true love from the very beginning of the film."" ]";5

Honestly, it reminds me a lot of Trainspotting in the sheer terror it can create and the general atmosphere of hopelessness. Some call this an astute political allegory, but if the only element of that is that scientific experimentation will eventually bite us in the ass and lead to the demise of us all, then it is hardly profound. Despite that, it is an undeniably smartly crafted sci-fi horror film. Really, the film has far more to say on the front that nobody can be trusted in times of danger, especially those entrusted to protect you.

The action is well directed by JJ Abrams and the film most certainly entertains. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Keri Russell, are also really good. The scene with Russell has also left me paranoid whenever I have a headache, so thanks for that Mission: Impossible III.

It is a very compelling look at the real life issues recruits face and what gifts they are tempted with in order to go to certain schools. That said, the film does have a few problems that are quite major. First off, it is too long. At nearly two hours and twenty minutes, He Got Game overstays its welcome by a little bit. The story is over-the-top and Lee's flair for theatrics is ever present here and he can never help himself but indulge in sillier and sillier plot points (really, the premise is a bit far fetched to begin with). Additionally, character motivations are deeply unclear, namely Ray Allen's. Things occur unnaturally and is a very movie type of way, in that they occur because they have to in order for Lee to try and make a point and for the plot to move along.

The writing is smart and the direction from Barry Levinson is solid with the film having very good pacing and being quite coherent.

The direction from James Mangold is very good, as he managed to help this film not get lost with its complex and unique premise, which is impressive to say the least. I also really liked the cinematography here, really captured everything beautifully. The acting from John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, and John Hawkes, is really good, though the whole cast is pretty strong as a unit. Overall, Identity is one that will have you questioning what is going on throughout and while it is not one that will eat you up inside for a few days afterwards with questions, it is one that will stay with you thanks to the impeccable last half hour and, hell, strong first hour preceding that.

He killed his role here and really stole the show, not to say that Madeline Stowe or Bruce Willis were not good, because they were. This one certainly keeps you guessing until the end and really sinks its hooks deep into you and does not let go until the film is over. The only thing about this one is that I saw in some places that it is considered a satire, though I never really found it funny. Sure, Pitt's over the top performance is at times funny, but for the most part, that is about it.

Showing great attention to detail in every sequence, especially the opening one where Indiana steals the golden idol from a booby-trapped Peruvian temple, every inch of this film feels iconic. It is not  a classic for no reason as Spielberg knows how to capture a viewer with imaginative action scenes with great peril, suspense, and thrills. The film later does this again when they find the Well of Souls and Indiana must avoid the snakes in the pit to find the Ark of the Covenant. These sequences show the potential thrills and rush to find the secrets buried beneath the Earth of a potential straight-forward archaeology film. That said, as the action-adventure scenes that they are, Spielberg makes the most of them, capturing them with typically beautiful camera work and attention to detail in the chambers."", ""That said, the film has unfortunately been treated quite poorly by time. The opening of the Ark and even the scenes in the Well of Souls are clearly done in some old set akin to those found in Legends of the Hidden Temple. While still fun and contributing to the cartoonish feeling instilled by the film and by its hero, it is definitely unfortunate to see so many great scenes impacted so harshly by time and advances in technology. This cartoony feeling is really what makes this film so enjoyable though, so no complaints there whatsoever. It may prevent it from being a great film, as too much silliness is never a good thing, but Raiders of the Lost Ark has just the right amount and is a fun romp as a result."", ""My major complaints with this film are a few things. From cliche over-the-top Nazi bad guys who are comically and unconvincingly evil to some predictable elements in the action scenes (Marion bumping right into a bunch of skeletons plays out too predictably and fails to gel), it often feels as though Indiana Jones is going beat-to-beat instead of properly flowing. Perhaps this is an issue in the editing or just the general cliches and tropes at work in the film that make it feel so halted at times, but it is the main issue that I have with Indiana Jones. While the film is still enjoyable and makes good use of its cliches, the film too often tries to surprise via its cliches and it rarely works. The film also has a few moments that make really no sense. For example, them breaking out of the Well of Souls by going through just two walls. The latter of two having a brick that was already disjarred. Evidently, it was not as impossible to get out of as previously imagined. Second, the one the that really threw me for a loop was when Indiana is on the U-Boat. How the hell does one stowaway on a submarine? But, even more egregious, the Nazis literally see him on the U-Boat and exclaim, \""There he is!\"" before they just shove off back to the base and do not search for him. He is just hiding in the base with no explanation of how he evaded detection. It really made me wonder if I had missed something. Though more egregious than most situations, the film relies upon so many conveniences where characters pop up somewhere they should never be at just because they need to be for the movie to advance, that it really sucks some of the enjoyment out of the film as a whole. Finally, I know this is probably sacrilege, but I still do not like John Williams. Yes, the score sounds good, but it is annoying. It reaches astronomical volume levels at random points in the film and keeps popping up like the laugh track in Big Bang Theory. While it may sound good, it feels as though Williams constantly screams out the musical notes instead of just playing the music at an acceptable volume. This overuse of music showcases how the film tries to use its music to manipulate the audience into feeling tension or emotion and it is a well that Spielberg returns to far too often. The film is tense and thrilling without the music, yet he relies upon this crutch."" ]";5

I think this one could have been even better, but it seemed content being what it was and was relatively safe all around. In addition, I just never really bought into John C. Reilly's performance. All of the other performances were great, but his stood out to me as something that just did not quite fit with the rest of the film."" ]";5
1383;spider;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Spider is a film that left me feeling quite cold initially. Not nearly as weird as David Cronenberg's early work, Spider is a more reserved film with an hour and a half of Ralph Fiennes exclusively mumbling. He has a few lines, but mostly just mumbles those too. Thus, it was a hard film to pin down and truly wring enjoyment out of from beginning to end. However, the finale is what cements this as a brilliant work. Far more reserved and grounded than Cronenberg is known for, Spider is an exploration of the mind of a broken man. Why is he forced to live out his days in an asylum after being seemingly fine as a child? Well, Cronenberg gives you the unexpected answer in a finale that elevates the entire film into being a very good character study."", ""Mumbling, bumbling, and stumbling his way through the film, Dennis \""Spider\"" Cleg (Ralph Fiennes) is a broken man. In a halfway home after leaving the asylum, he relives part of his childhood in his mind. Living with a devoted mother, Mrs. Cleg (Miranda Richardson), he has an alcoholic father Bill (Gabriel Byrne). His mediocre life gets worse when he believes he sees his father begin to find another woman attractive. Soon, this turn into a full blown affair and possible murder. This shakes the very core of the boy and, whatever mental issues he had before, become exacerbated and truly take hold. The boy is traumatized by what transpires and it leaves him turning into his own mind and tying strings around his room like a spider web. The broken adult version of Dennis shows no signs of overcoming what he has seen, still visibly shaken and incredibly meek."", ""This character study of a man and an exploration of what troubles him so is incredibly sympathetic. Blocking out traumatic experiences and the horror it causes him when he realizes what really occurred in beautifully captured by Cronenberg. Fiennes never has a freak out, he just looks dead in the eyes and carries this look throughout. He just floats through life in a brilliantly reserved and sympathetic portrayal of this man. Cronenberg, for his part, makes the trauma real and authentic. Seen through the eyes of a boy, it is easy to see how things can be misunderstood and such traumatic incidences certainly leave him pushing the events out of his mind. The finale reveals the truth and is incredibly well handled and makes a lot of sense. In this way, the film becomes quite shocking due to the unexpected nature of the finale and how all of the pieces fit together. In many ways, the film is like a puzzle and Cronenberg hints at that throughout. After a glass window shatters, the asylum workers put together the window again to ensure all the broken pieces are there. The end result looks like a puzzle and a spider web. For Dennis, he also tries to put together a real puzzle, but gets incredibly frustrated and throws it across the room.  This is also symbolic for the viewer as the film takes some time to come together. The pieces do not fit perfectly and instead get caught up in the web spun by Cronenberg himself. It can be a frustrating and challenging experience as this is a reserved film that refuses to give way to dramatics. A character study that shows how we compartmentalize things and the damaging impact it can have on our psyche, Spider is a film that messes with your mind and thrills in equal measure. Yet, it is a film that does not feature kooky David Cronenberg. Rather, he avoids theatrics and shock, instead going for a slowly unwinding mental knot of confusion and trauma. For his part, Fiennes is brilliant, even if his lines are limited. He truly shows his range here as he plays a man mostly through just emoting and looks in his eyes. He is not forced into acting crazy or having breakdowns at any point. Rather, his pain is far more subtle and somberly portrayed. Spider is a film that explores mental illness with grace and class, refusing to turn the mentally ill into mere props for entertainment. Instead, it shows the horror that the mind can produce for those that suffer from any form of mental illness."" ]";5

A subtly put together film, The Quiet American feels cut from the same cloth as something such as Casablanca, which I was not expecting. An oddly romantic love letter to the escape Vietnam provided for some, The Quiet American is also incredibly romantic in a more traditional sense with a truly engaging look at relationships forged during such troubling times. The subtle direction from Phillip Noyce is fantastic as is the very good writing that does a great job crafting these characters. As for the acting, Michael Caine turns in an absolutely phenomenal performance. It honestly may be one of the best performances I have been blessed to see. Brendan Fraser does very good as well when faced with the impossible task of out-acting Caine. Overall, The Quiet American is a truly engaging film that is very nuanced and incredibly subtle. To me, it feels like an old-time film that somehow got made in 2002 and thank God for that."" ]";5

However, what is revolutionary here is the direction from Rob Marshall. The transition from stage to screen is brilliant here and the film simultaneously feels as though it were a play and a film at times. The set pieces and production value here are fantastic as this film feels like a spectacle throughout and it honestly feels like you are watching something quite special at times as a result. The costume design is authentic and, along with the production design, capture the look and feel of old Chicago very well. Finally, the music here is pitch perfect and a true joy to listen to and watch be performed. Overall, Chicago is not outstanding on the whole, but is quite a good film that is incredibly entertaining."" ]";5

My main criticism with him, as much as I do like him, is that he frequently seems to just play himself in many films. Here, however, he does anything but. Steven Soderbergh's direction is great and the visual effects here of space and of the planet Solaris are breathtakingly gorgeous and really something to marvel at. In that way and in terms of what it all means, reminds me a lot of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Very ambigious, confusing, slow, and beautiful, Solaris is really quite brilliant, though a tough nut to crack. Personally, I am still racking my brain over what everything in this one meant and trying to figure out what I am supposed to take away. Ultimately, however, I think this is an orange you can peel in many different ways, which makes it all the more intriguing. Personally, I think there are many plausible explanations, whether they be on reality (what is truly real?), love (and its everlasting nature), and death (where will we reunite, if we ever do? letting go or can you truly ever let go?). It raises many interesting questions and it may not have all the answers and is most certainly very flawed at times and leaves many unanswerable questions (unless \""I don't know\"" is an answer). However, in spite of that, I adored this one. I love films with ambiguity and ones that raise many questions that make it fun to discuss and this is a classic example of that. Now, I would never recommend it to anyone, because if I did, odds are they would come back and call me an idiot since this one is an acquired taste, but I loved it all the same."" ]";5

As with the first film, the acting is beyond impressive, the script is great, the cinematography is great, and the action beautifully done. However, first and foremost worthy of praise is the special effects. How they do what they do is mesmerizing to me. In addition, the characters are completely engrossing and brilliant to watch as they transverse this immaculately designed and imagined world they live in. As with the first film, this film is the definition of an epic and is a stunningly great sequel to what was a great first film. I did not believe the first film could be improved upon (I do think this one is ever so slightly better), but dammit, it was.

Using really unique animation and an off-beat tone courtesy of director Richard Linklater, A Scanner Darkly is an interestingly put together film that just feels...off. Aside from the aforementioned tone, it feels somehow unsatisfactory like a meal that tastes pretty good, but is not filling. In addition, its plotting can be a little convoluted at times that creates problems when trying to follow the plot of the film. While far from perfect, A Scanner Darkly is too interestingly put together to ignore thanks to Linklater's typically stellar writing and direction, plus the unique approach to Philip K.

1390;halloween-1978;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A chilling horror film from director John Carpenter, Halloween is not without its age spots (what else did you expect after 38 years?), but remains an effective thriller to this day that has influenced a genre ever since it was released. Though Carpenter heavily riffs off of Alfred Hitchcock's horror masterpiece Psycho, Halloween is scary in its own right, though it often uses the same skills Hitchcock demonstrated in Psycho to make Halloween enter the next level of scariness."", """", ""Okay, the acting is bad. I tried to lessen the hurt there, but it honestly was really bad. In saying that, however, I do not expect much in this regard. The point of the film is to scare you, not wow you with the prowess of that actors. That said, it was bad enough to mention."", """", ""On the positive column is practically everything else. Brilliantly utilizing sound in a fashion shown off by Hitchcock's Psycho, the film utilizes deeply unsettling sounds that honestly scare you on their own. Forget the visuals. The sound is scary enough on its own thanks to the film's use of sounds that not just alert you that something scary is about to happen, but have no chemistry whatsoever with your ears. When watching a film such as this, the score really sets the mood and boy does it ever accomplish this in Halloween."", """", ""As far as the characterization of Michael Myers goes, John Carpenter does a great job establishing the lore of Myers and telling rather than showing. Instead of showing us his time in the mental institution, it merely tells us what happened there, which ups the scariness and impact of the stories. In most films, this is a mortal sin. For horror films, it can be a brilliant tactic and Carpenter uses it perfectly. Thanks to the doctor's descriptions, we get a clear picture in our minds of what Myers is, what he looks like, and how he acts. This mental image is far scarier than anything Carpenter could have shown us."", """", ""Additionally, the film never rushes proceedings. It is more than happy to sit back and wait to build anticipation. Rather than having Michael run around killing everybody in sight, he bides his time and significantly ups the tension by building it and building it up. This anticipation completely boils over when things finally hit the fan and the tension is dialed up to 11. While cliched by today's time, the climax of this film was really the first of its kind (if I am not mistaken, Halloween was the first film to kill the antagonist only to bring him to life again). Plus, though it can be a bit silly at times thanks to it being done to death by 2016, Carpenter handles the reveals very well. With over the shoulder shots from Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) to Michael's \""dead\"" body, the shot of him standing up becomes all the more terrifying. As a result, this is truly a film that defines the horror genre and the way in which we watch the movie, become terrified, and yell at the screen, \""BEHIND YOU\"". Halloween is ripe with these moments and really benefits from it."", """", ""Halloween is a tough film to watch nowadays. Though there is an ever present sense of dread, a killer score, and endless tension, the film has truly been copied on a daily basis since its release 38 years ago.  As a whole, Halloween is a thoroughly scary and entertaining affair from John Carpenter with unmistakable influence from Psycho and on later films. Interestingly, there is little-to-no gore in Halloween, yet films that will rip it off for years to come bathe everybody in blood. Odd. Also, did anybody notice the cheeky foreshadowing of Carpenter's future remake of The Thing?"" ]";5
1391;gangs-of-new-york;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Gangs of New York is extremely ambitious and Scorsese tries to cover a lot, but in doing so, he really covers none of it. A lot of things were touched on, but none of it ever felt satisfying. In spite of that, the film was far too long. Thus, a lot of things could have been cut since they did not have a major impact on anything and then the film could have focused in on more important aspects of the film in better depth. Finally, the film is a little violent for my taste, though shortening it would undoubtedly satisfy the issue. Ultimately, the scope Scorsese attempts to go for is the film's true undoing, as everything else is great. The sets and costume design are marvelous. The foundation laid by the film for the rivalry between the \""natives\"" and the Irish, plus the desire for revenge is great. The corruption aspect was very welll done as well. Then the final shot of New York over time and the final words by DiCaprio are beautiful and perfect for the moment. In terms of acting, Daniel Day-Lewis is phenomenal. Cameron Diaz was also fine, I have no idea why she gets so much hate for this role, as I had no issues with her. She was not phenomenal by any means, but she was fine. I love DiCaprio, but he was certainly spotty in parts, though he was fine for the most part. However, there was far too much fluff added onto the main plot that really comes off as extra.

Well-written and well crafted, this melancholy little comedy-drama has a unique approach to its topic that separates it from similar films, while also never becoming boring.

In addition, Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx both do quite well in the lead roles and really have great chemistry as a duo. As with all actiony type films, it requires some leap of faith, a leap I am willing to take here as it never gets too outlandish. Sure, you can criticize all of the moving parts here and claim a lot of it to be untrue and far-fetched, but to me, it tried to keep an air of realism throughout. It never went too outlandish and unbelievable. I never saw the TV series, yet I managed to enjoy this one a good bit and it was really all I was hoping for. An entertaining, stylish, action crime thriller directed by the ever masterful Michael Mann. I am not necessarily surprised to see that this one is divisive amongst critics between those who love it and those who hate it, but to me, where this one won me over is simply in the style.

Though off-the-charts stupid and featuring a few too many explosions, Bad Boys has a great time and is unafraid to show the audience how much it is having. Pairing together Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as the iconic Miami PD cop duo, Bad Boys' two charismatic leads carry the weight of this two hour film right on their shoulders and never waver. Together, they turn this otherwise disposable action flick into a quintessential buddy comedy that should be retitled, \""Male Banter: The Movie\"". As a male who enjoys banter, Bad Boys was right up my alley."", ""Advertising Ford and Coke along the way, Bad Boys is so stupid, it features Will Smith running through Miami with his shirt flying open after a Ford. He damn near catches the thing too. Hardly an endorsement of the brand, I would say. The film also tacks on Tea Leoni running around in a miniskirt for just shy of two hours. Not very becoming of the Secretary of State, but I guess we all have our wild and crazy phase. Bay shamelessly sexualizes her in every shot of this film and, while that can be a bit icky at times, it is merely par for the course in Michael Bay films and male-targeted action films. There will be bombs, bullets, and babes. Bottom line. Unfortunate to see a talented actress wasted as eye candy though, as she deserves far better. However, Bay does heavily sexualize Will Smith here as well, so it does sort of counter the scopophilia aimed at Leoni with some eye candy for the lady (singular intended) in the audience as well."", ""Action-wise, Bad Boys is pretty bombastic. It is always fun and derivative with European bad guys and a convoluted-for-such-a-simplistic-movie plot, but it really does embrace this craziness via its leads. With Marcus Bennett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) switching identities for convenience sake, Bad Boys is always poorly plotted. There is no reason for them to switch identities. Just tell Julie (Leoni) that you are Mike's partner and wait for him to get home, then problem solved. But, oh no, we have to pretend that this is a complicated situation that demands lying and manipulation at every step. This is why Bay's movies are always so dumb because they have fun, know they are supposed to be fun, but add on layers of plot and convolutedness that really do nothing. Fortunately, Bad Boys is incredibly fun. Lawrence and Smith are well matched as partners and their two-hour long banter session is the reason why I came away really enjoying this diversion. They both have tremendous comedic timing and the writing is incredibly funny in this section. Yet, all of the banter really emphasizes the friendship and bond between the two partners. They love one another and are unafraid to risk their lives to save the life of their best friend. More so than any buddy cop film, Bad Boys establishes two guys who are indebted to one another and both of them know it. For all of its inadequacies, Bad Boys really creates a great portrait of male friendship, which is impressive in a testosterone driven action film."", ""Action-packed with charismatic turns from its comedically adept leads, Bad Boys is simply a ton of fun. Much of this review sounds like a half-hearted endorsement, but I rarely like stupid action comedies like Bad Boys. The fact that I came away enjoying this has to mean something. At the very least, the pairing together of Smith and Lawrence is eminently watchable and covers up the inadequacies of the script and Bay's direction with a huge band-aid."" ]";5

The cinematography from Roger Deakins is awe inspiring at times, especially when it comes to its use of candlelight. The score is also fantastic and accents the film very well, while giving it the epic feel to match its wide scope. That said, the film does have structural issues to the point that it can be somewhat disjointed. The vast majority of the scenes work very well, but they feel entirely off when put next to each other. As a vignette into the early life of the Dalai Lama, it is brilliant, yet unclear and emotionally distant, never packing the punch it should. Fortunately, strong acting makes up for this, but this is definitely Scorsese-lite, never reaching the cohesive picture it absolutely could. Yet, its ambition and beauty cannot be underrated and is a worthy take on the Dalai Lama and his role in Tibetan culture. Overall, Kundun is a good film that is simply held back by story issues which prevent the film from reaching the heights Scorsese aimed for."" ]";5

Now, luckily for him, the film has a very interesting plot and storyline that Lee does tell well, but the true reason why 25th Hour is so successful is the acting. Truly a great cast, Edward Norton, Barry Pepper, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rosario Dawson, Brian Cox, and Anna Paquin, are all awesome in this one and truly carry it. Norton and Hoffman are two of my favorite actors of all-time, but yet I cannot help but feel as though Pepper kind of stole the show a little bit. He was just that good.

The duo have an insane time on the stage and off of it with the actors brilliantly portraying their roles. Meyers and McGregor really soar here and draw the eyes on them, while making it more than worth our time. McGregor particularly nails his role as a free spirit with a kooky, hypnotic, and drug-infused performance as Curt Wild."", ""That said, as with any Haynes film, the film is a huge comment on both the time period in which it occurs and on sexuality. The film violently embraces sexual freedom and champions these men as leaders of the sexual revolution. Even more importantly, it shows that these men are not gay. They may have gay experiences, but find value in both sexes and are bisexual. To wear make-up and women's clothing, it does not necessarily make a person gay. Rather, it is an expression of what they feel inside and Haynes shows this terrifically. Even more, he depicts this embracing of taboo as having a huge impact on those around them. These people are here to show that this is not some weird, shameful action. Instead, it is merely who they are and you can either accept them or not, but they will be who they are. Their parents are pissed, reject them, and send them for shock treatment. But, their fans adore them and are willing to ride the wave with them. Unfortunately, it is not easy and they must find the right crowd and people actually open to new things and change. Though initially booed at performances, Slade and Wild soon become hits that are free to embrace every crevice of their personality and explore it openly."", ""The film does get quite bogged down by Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale) in the modern day, however. A man touched by the openness of these glam rockers and who was at many of their concerts, while being exposed to the live of open sexuality practiced by these men, his investigation feels tacked on. Perhaps Haynes or the studio thought the film was too experiential and distant, so they needed another character to act as an audience surrogate, but it does not work. He investigates where Brian Slade went after an infamous performance act and it adds another wrinkle to the film, but it ultimately detracts from it. Unfortunately, the film ends with wrapping up Arthur's story, which is largely uninteresting and unengaging, leaving the film with an unsatisfactory finale."", ""Fortunately, Velvet Goldmine is still a terrific film that takes on a fairy tale feeling thanks to the opening narration by Janet McTeer. Hinting at the ambition Haynes had with this film, this narration sets the tone and dream-like feeling of the film. Though a little bloated with Bale's role in the film, it is an incredibly dynamic and hypnotic film that more than entertains and also shows the events that led to the de-tabooization of sexuality in all its forms."" ]";5

A very easy watch, this one is simply a fun and fast paced film that tells a riveting story that really hooks you in from the get go. Steven Spielberg directs this one brilliantly as usual and really tells the story of Frank Abagnale is a unique and enjoyable way. Leonardo DiCaprio is phenomenal here, as are Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, and Martin Sheen. Really great cast on paper and they all did a great job in practice. The film does a really good job painting Abagnale as neither a bad guy or a good guy, rather you just feel sympathy for him since he is so smart, but uses his brains to steal, which is too bad and, plus, his rough home life certainly makes him even more sympathetic. Overall, Catch Me If You Can is a really well told, well acted, and well directed, film, that is just infinitely fun to watch."" ]";5
1406;king-kong;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Both incredibly racist and sexist, King Kong is a classic tale that so overlong it truly hurts. While entertaining and well acted, the film could have stood to be far shorter. Fortunately, it packs its overstuffed runtime with entertaining sequences and spectacular special effects. Naomi Watts is fantastic here and brings raw emotion to the role as the white woman whose beauty and whiteness tames the savage black man. While the overt racism inherent in the story suffocates it pretty good, racist films can still be quite good and King Kong is a perfect example of this. There is a seriously epic feel to the film and it is well handled by Jackson who knows his way around an epic. If the film was shorter, then the overall film would be far more enjoyable because the extravagant set pieces and scenes pack the right amount of power, but the filler winds up stunting that excitement. Heck, the film could keep all the scenes, but they could be just a touch shorter. Yet, the pay off was quite solid admittedly. Appropriately emotional and stirring, the ending really rips your heart out and makes you hate the people who did this to Kong. Overall, an appropriately epic blockbuster that entertains and thrills, but packed too much into just one film."" ]";5

A brilliant action film that is perfectly directed by James Cameron, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is well ahead of its time in terms of special effects and is overall just a  very well done and very entertaining spectacle. Arnold Schwarzenegger is great here as the Terminator and Linda Hamilton is very strong as Sarah Connor. The child actor who plays John Connor is pretty spotty and the film itself can be a little campy at times, but it never fails to entertain. Beautifully filmed action sequences combine with good drama here to make a very good film that is also very well written and quite funny at times.

1408;ran;10;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Ran is a masterpiece. Personally, I do not give out perfect ratings often. Every few months, maybe more, a film comes along that stuns me so thoroughly that a rating that is not a perfect score feels like heresy. Ran is that kind of film. From the story to the score to the cinematography to the colors, the film is a lyrical and poetic masterpiece from director Akira Kurosawa. Based on King Lear, Ran depicts the transfer of power from an old Lord to his eldest son, only for him to be subjected to watching his three sons destroy all that he built. A film about chaos of the mind and the world, Ran develops themes of family, respect, honor, nihilism, and postmodernism. An epic of profound scope, delicately brought to life by Kurosawa, Ran  is a film that immediately becomes one of my personal favorites."", ""Depicting the fall of the House of Ichimonji (fake), Ran is an exercise in trusting and respecting those that you what is on their mind, rather than lie to your face but cover it in complimentary words. In this way, Great Lord Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) is doomed to watch his lands fall to ruin after opting to trust those that to lie to him, if only because they bowed before him when they did it. Though the sons will be blamed for fracturing the family, in many ways, Hidetora fractured the family and the family was always doomed to fail. As he had three sons, the power struggle would have continued no matter when Hidetora died. In many ways, this could be described as Ran's way of showing that our actions do not mean anything (nihilism) and everything is pre-determined for us (free-will or lack thereof). This is even mentioned by one character who says to not blame the gods for what occurs because everything has already been determined. Thus, it can certainly be concluded that the Ichimonji were doomed from the start to fracture. However, by trusting his unfaithful sons over his most faithful son because he spoke his mind, Hidetora merely sped up the demise."", ""Additionally, Ran is an exercise in violence begetting violence. Towards the end, when Hidetora's life is one again struck with tragedy at the hands of his son's violence towards one another, he asks \""Is there no justice?\"" Though his pain is authentic and he is incredibly sympathetic, Hidetora losing his sons to war is justice in its purest form. Throughout the film, we see castles of lords killed by Hidetora. We are introduced to daughters that were witnesses to Hidetora slaughtering their families, only to then be married off to one of Hidetora's sons. For Hidetora to suffer as he made others suffer - by watching his family be destroyed - is justice and demonstrates that you \""reap what you sow\"" and \""violence begets violence\""."", ""Ran also heavily discusses chaos. In fact, its title translates to \""chaos\"". Yet, the chaos in the film is two-fold: of the mind and of the world. As he family falls apart, Hidetora goes mad. His mind is very literally chaos. Though he has moments of lucidity, his insanity destroys his mind and memory, causing him to forget what his sons look like and forgetting who a faithful servant was. All of these moments are painful to see, in particular with the servant. Faithful from the beginning, Kyoami (Shinnosuke Ikehata) is distraught to see his master forget who he is and the audience certainly feels his pain. The madness of Hidetora, however, is matched by the now war torn region he is surrounded by. With bloodshed, plots for power, and intrafamily conflicts, there is very little chaos and the film reflects this with long, drawn out battle sequences highlighting every element of brutality. Though chaos appears to happen quickly from the outside, it actually comes from very precise and small steps and Ran goes to great lengths to show the slow descent into chaos experienced by the House of Ichimonji. From plotting wives to power hungry siblings, the collapse is hardly a gradual one."", ""As with many Japanese films, Ran also delves into themes of family, respect, and loyalty. In particular, respect and loyalty are a large element of the film. With long scenes of men showcasing their loyalty by bowing or following their master into battle, Ran develops a constant theme of loyalty. Though some loyal men die, their loyalty is always celebrated, in particular when they do not stay quiet and instead speak their minds. Even if rebuked, they are proven to be right in the end and their original objections were proven to be justified. Had their warnings been headed, the collapse of the Ichimonj would not have happened. As such, Ran could be called a celebration of contrarians. Though they are unpopular figures, the words they speak come from the heart and should be heard clearly, in order to avoid making a fatal error."" ]";5

Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, and Harvey Keitel, are all very good, while Ralph Fiennes delivers an absolutely bone chilling performance as the \""Tooth Fairy\"". Philip Seymour Hoffman is also good in a supporting role. The direction from Brett Ratner is shockingly good. He did a great job creating scares and multiple scenes caused me to jump back a little bit, which is great. In addition, the script from Ted Tally is also very strong, not as good as the one who wrote for The Silence of the Lambs, but it worked very well. At times, this one can feel a bit like a police procedural, but all the same, I really did like this one and loved the way it ended as well (the very, very end). Some things could have been better, such as the beginning, and then some elements towards the end of the film that just felt cheesy, but all the same, Red Dragon is a good film that entertains in its two hours and is really well made."" ]";5

The film has fantastic production design and costume design, which both perfectly fit the period. Additionally, the actors have great chemistry with one another and were clearly quite well directed by Haynes as they never overact, as can be the case in melodramas.

I loved it in the beginning, lost it in the middle, came back around towards the end, lost it again, but then the final sequence convinced me I did enjoy the film. Now, these moments are not attributable to general flaws in the film. Definitely imperfect and highly flawed, Femme Fatale is simply just a cold and unwelcoming film. It slinks along and is both slow and precise, which makes it a hard film to fully appreciate in a single viewing. Yet, what is not hard to appreciate is a great De Palma mystery thriller with solid performances that keeps you guessing until the very end."", ""The greatest flaw in Femme Fatale is also the biggest spoiler, but it comes towards the end and definitely changes the perspective of the film. Here, much of the film seems to come together initially, but then back pedals and turns on its heels. As I always this kind of twist, the same applies here to Femme Fatale, which is unfortunate in an otherwise low-key and mysterious film that it would rely upon such a silly moment. Fortunately, it does turn around and return to being this mysterious film. With small details, terrific direction of the actors in terms of placing them in the frame and on the set, the final sequence is the highlight of the film. Bar none. Featuring De Palma's flair with big set pieces, this one has a lot of moving parts that come together poetically and make this third act come off with cinematic brilliance."", ""Not really featuring many notable tracking shots (obviously they are there, but none that really caught my eye as many of De Palma's tracking shots do), the film does feature a lot of split-screen. The other really notable tenant of any De Palma film, the split-screen is used heavily in this film and to exquisite effect. The split between Nicolas Bardo (Antonio Banderas) and our femme fatale Laure (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as Bardo takes pictures of her while on his balcony is incredible. De Palma uses this twice to show Bardo on his balcony during the second act and then again towards the beginning of the third. Both are pure brilliance and just look phenomenal on the screen."", ""As for the plot, it is honestly convoluted and a lot of it seems incredibly fortunate/convenient (particularly events surrounding the \""seven years later\"" element), but the film is not set in the real world by any means. In a way, it is sort of fantastical, highlighted by the stilted and awkward dialogue and performances. Banderas and Romijn-Stamos hardly act human in this film. They seem almost robotic or alien. This could be attributed to bad acting, but it does feel entirely purposeful when considered in the context of the final twist that I may not have liked, but does make sense. There is a reason why this film unrealistic and almost dream-like throughout and the acting contributes to this feeling. Yet, the mystery element here is in large due to Romijn-Stamos' performance. Inherently mysterious, her character leaves Bardo and the audience completely in the dark throughout. De Palma does not offer a helping hand and forces his audience to put it together themselves as to what is occurring. By the end, things begin to come together, extraneous moments are enveloped in the rest of the plot, and the film begins to make sense. However, you must be willing to put it together because it is quite convoluted and, as I said, De Palma offers no assistance."", ""Thrilling, mysterious, and entirely unique, Femme Fatale is an engaging, hard to crack, and completely compelling work by Brian De Palma. As with much of his work, it is incredibly divisive, yet has been praised by certain critics (Ebert) and for good reason. De Palma knows how to make a movie and how to keep an audience on the edge of their seat throughout. Though cold and convoluted, Femme Fatale is a worthy film, but only if you are willing to provide the warmth and attention it needs to make sense."" ]";5

Visually stunning with a pitch perfect score, the opening film of Kieslowski's acclaimed Three Colors trilogy and first entry into his filmography is an utter marvel for the eyes, the senses, and the heart. Utilizing a sapphire look to the film to encapsulate the main theme of grief, the film tells the story of Julie (Juliette Binoche) grieving after the death of her husband and daughter. After initially shutting off the world, she learns to reopen her heart and move on after his death by returning to her generous and loving self. Open to a wide variety of interpretations, it is a tough task to try and put your finger on what this film is ultimately trying to say to you, but one thing is certain: it is brilliant."", """", ""With a beautiful score from Zbigniew Preisner, the music takes center stage in Three Colors: Blue with numerous scenes fading to black to allow the music to really hit some high notes before fading back in to continue the scene. There is even a sequence at the end where Kieslowski opts to have the camera go out of focus as Julie and Olivier (Benoit Regent) work on finishing the concerto written by Julie's late husband Patrice. A beautiful sequence of indescribable melody, the film's music really encapsulates the sheer beauty and wonder of this film. I am no music expert, but to say that the music in this film is beautiful and meaningful would be a terrific understatement."", """", ""The cinematography is beautiful, but then again, I am a sucker for any significant use of color as is displayed in this film. Often signifying depression, sadness, or simply grief, blue is used to perfection in this film. Though not every shot is draped in blue, certainly a significant portion of it is displaying blue to some degree. The way in which Kieslowski works in the color in seemingly mundane ways is brilliant and highlights the detailed and subtle nature of this masterpiece."", """", ""On that point, Three Colors: Blue is an incredibly detailed film that demands to be re-watched multiple times in order to not just pick-up on everything that Kieslowski is laying down, but to also try and come to some kind of determination as to what the film is telling you. For me, the story is about a woman grieving and learning how to deal with that grief. After initially destroying everything that meant something to her old life and liberating herself from that weight, she learns that the past cannot be escaped. Instead, by embracing her past and letting herself move past the pain, she will liberate herself from it. Rather than running, she can stand still and move past her immense grief. That said, maybe I am way off."", """", ""Overall, Three Colors: Blue practically never puts a foot wrong.

1415;army-of-darkness;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Objectively, two things are true about Army of Darkness. One, it is definitely not very good. Two, I totally screwed up. I had no idea this was a follow-up to Evil Dead and Evil Dead II. Who would guess it, but I had never seen either. Whoops. Mea culpa on that one. Fortunately, I get the feeling I did not miss much plot-wise. 81 minutes long, Army of Darkness is a fast-paced, stupid, and incredibly fun horror comedy. From director Sam Raimi, Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) reclaims his chainsaw, witty commentary, and need to kill the evil dead in this conclusion to the trilogy (apparently). While hardly perfect, it is impossible to deny that Army of Darkness is really stupid fun."", ""Due to its runtime and focus on action, the film largely forgets its plot, which stands as the biggest issue. Dumped into the Middle Ages after seeing the Book of the Dead, Ash must fight his way out of various situations and then awakens an army of the dead in the process. Otherwise, it is just chainsaw goodness and women with large breasts serving him. There is not much meat on this bone and very little to digest. Mind you, the film surrounding the plot is fun enough to make you forget there is no plot, but it is a flaw nonetheless. Towards the middle, when the plot can continuously repeat itself with its silly action and jokes along the way, the lack of plot is really felt."", ""That said, Bruce Campbell is born for this role and hysterical. Charismatic, cool, calm, and collected, Campbell's Ash delivers each punch line to perfection. He is the core of this film and is what it is riding on. He has terrific fun in this film with all the silly gags and seems to derive great pleasure from kicking zombie ass. On that note, Raimi also has a ton of fun here. With bad special effects and low-bar jokes, Army of Darkness is a goofy and entirely tongue-in-cheek affair. He knows it is dumb and outlandish, but that is exactly why he is doing it. This reason is mainly why the bad effects are excusable because it is partially due to limited technology and mostly due to Raimi's own cheesy intention. Bad effects are the perfect backdrop for the quip-ready Ash who has his own special brand of machismo that makes him a truly unique action hero."", ""On that note, Ash definitely fits some of Yvonne Tasker's definition of a male action hero in the 1980s and apparently early 1990s. Putting his male body through torture via cutting off his own hand, being against the system (defends the middle ages people to save a girl), and saving a damsel in distress, Ash is the quintessential male action hero, though his body does not necessarily become spectacle and suffer from constant torture, aside from the hand the pixie that breaks into his body. In that way, he is a bit of subversion of this and shows Raimi's satirical inclination in the film with even the action hero and action he performs being tongue-in-cheek representations of competing action films of the time."", ""Funny, subversive, and flat out stupid, Army of Darkness has literally no plot, but is fun because of its bad effects and Bruce Campbell. While I wish I had seen the first two entries in the trilogy first, Army of Darkness is entertaining and fun in its own right, separate from the other Evil Dead films."" ]";5
1416;harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The second cinematic adventure set in this wondrous world of wizardry and magic, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a stepback in the series. Retaining the sense of child-like wonder in a very Spielbergian sense, the film's great characters and effects are left in a \""too-cute\"" plot loaded with too many deus ex machinas. As another entry into this marvelously imaginative world, however, The Chamber of Secrets packs the same level of tension, terror, and joyous fun that is fun in The Sorcerer's Stone, especially with its central mystery. The unfortunate part of this film is that, aside from a few new elements, nothing has really changed from the first entry aside from just making it longer and swapping out a few characters. It is building a world, but this is a very lateral move compared to the grand steps forward taken by better universes."", ""The changes from The Sorcerer's Stone are mostly character-driven, as the plot is pretty much the same. Starting off with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) not getting letters, living with his abusive aunt and uncle, and then rushing off to Hogwarts with the Weasley family, the film feels very \""same\"" at the onset. Unfortunately, this does not change much as the film builds up around a central mystery lurking in a secret area of Hogwarts, Hermione (Emma Watson) demonstrates that she is the best wizard of the bunch before being whisked away to let Harry be the hero, and they play Quidditich in a rigged match against Slytherin house. As a unit, they save the day and uncover the mystery with the new way in which Lord Voldemort has snuck his way back into Hogwarts to cause serious damage to the students and the school as a whole. Why this guy bothers himself with young wizards is beyond me when his beef should be with the older people, but I digress. This same plot hits many right notes, especially when establishing the mystery lying within the Chamber of Secrets and its slow, intoxicating build-up to the reveal. From the spider's lair to the messages written in blood, the film feels quite ominous as matched by the haunting voice following Harry around whispering \""kill kill kill\"". At times, the film feels like a gothic horror film due to its reliance on atmosphere and a terrific sense of space within the school's excellent gothic-inspired design."", ""The film's changes from the first hit with a mixed bag of results. The most positive addition is Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh). Between the two films I have seen thus far, he is undoubtedly my favorite characters. He is such a fraud and coward, it is honestly hysterical to watch unfold with Branagh being a natural for the role as this self-absorbed heartthrob. The original casting of Hugh Grant would have also been brilliant, though Branagh did an excellent job with the role. The other positive change is Dobby, who is like the ALDI store brand Yoda. However, as a BDSM loving house-elf, Dobby is excellently funny even if he is a deeply tragic figure."", ""Where the film changes, however, it does have some negatives. With Snape (Alan Rickman) enjoying a far more scaled back role in this film, the film really lacks the zip and sinister bite of Rickman that the original had. It tries to recreate it with Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), but it never clicks. Isaacs is good, but he is no Rickman. The film lacks that sneakily ominous presence provided by him and Lucius winds up being nothing more than a rather conventional sinister presence in the film that is never really utilized here to its fullest. Additionally, the general lack of Emma Watson is really felt here with Radcliffe and Rupert Grint left on their own with Watson's Hermione petrified or turned into the cat for much of the film. In spite of her strength, the film annoyingly turns her into a joke or damsel in distress despite her talent as a wizard that far exceeds that of her male counterparts. Relying upon Harry's purity and Ron's awkward ginger nature to carry the film, it winds up feeling too sweet and buddy comedy-esque without ever really clicking the way it would with a strong female presence in the film. Had the film relied upon Watson as much as it did in the Philosopher’s Stone, this second entry would have felt more balanced. The other change that really holds this one back is more of an alteration. The first one’s childish touches coming in Quidditich or awarding the cup winner at the end of the year were fine and excusable, even if unbearable. Here, Columbus adds childish touches to the plot. With overt foreshadowing, random exposition to accompany that foreshadowing, and then explaining items that were previously explained to call back to that foreshadowing-based exposition, the Chamber of Secrets feels really spelled out. There is no mystery as to why the phoenix is able to heal Harry or why the sword appears. Instead, it feels very spoon-fed and, as a result, it largely misses the mark. The sense of wonder is still there, but some spark has been put out."" ]";5

Each image is beautifully crafted and not enough praise can be given to it. Road to Perdition is a definite slow burner, but never fails to completely grip you and really pays off at the end with a very touching, tragic, and moving, ending. For the most part, this one really rises above what you would expect from a typical gangster film and really finds a way to make all of these people seem entirely human.

Additionally, the film received some criticism for being too slow, but I never felt that way. It was certainly on the slower side of things, but I never found the pacing of the film to be an issue. Rather, I appreciated that it did not feel the need to rush things along. However, the script kind of falters at times, namely that the story can quite muddled and jumbled at times. Characters come into the film and only come back later with minor significance, but you miss information because you spend too much time trying to remember who they were. This is Hollywoodland's biggest sin as it can come off as though there are too many characters and too much going on at times, which really muddle things up a bit.

As he gets closer and closer, the tension builds and builds and this one truly takes some weird and creepy turns that I did not expect, but all the same, it winds up being a very compelling psychological thriller that really gets you going and serves as a great character study thanks to the subtle, yet brilliant performance from Williams.

Through a truly creepy atmosphere set by director Gore Verbinski and composer Hans Zimmer, The Ring keeps you on edge without having to terrify you. In this way, The Ring is far more thriller than horror film, rather it is a thriller with horror elements. The way it adds to this with a great mystery/detective component as they try to figure out the backstory to the tape is captivating and truly engaging. I know it is a remake, but it still felt very refreshing in that way. Naomi Watts is great in this one, as are David Dorfman and Brian Cox. There may be scarier horror-type films out there, but not many as well crafted and put together as The Ring.

However, when things go sideways and an unexpected incident occurs, Steven's plans are shattered and he must evade detection by the now suspicious Emily."", ""While it may not re-write on 1990s thrillers, A Perfect Murder nonetheless often embodies their best elements. Building great anticipation for the planned murder through meticulous pacing and planning by Steven and David, the film allows the audience to visualize the murder and how it will happen right before it finally does happen. This anticipation turns into great tension as the moment finally occurs and we watch Steven plan his alibi and put every wheel into motion that he knows will see him exonerated. Once the attack occurs and the cops show up, the tension rises dramatically. Somehow, Emily is still alive and now Steven must cover up his tracks. Forcing the audience to recall every element that he put in place beforehand as he must now clean up any mess leftover by the would-be killer, A Perfect Murder shows these loose ends throughout the rest of its run-time and his efforts to snuff them out before Emily and the cops detect anything. Thrilling and similarly showing the psychotic nature of this crime, A Perfect Murder is a film that drops you into the mind of a killer and, somehow, gets you root for him as he tries to navigate the minefield of a cover-up he has made for himself when his plan goes haywire in the execution phase."", ""What really helps to sell A Perfect Murder as better than your average thriller is the acting. Though the film is riddled with cliches, it is the acting of its cast that allows it to really soar and carve out its own name. Chief among this is Michael Douglas. He really made his name for playing these men in poor relationships such as in Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct, bringing this knowledge and his ability as an actor to the table for his role in A Perfect Murder. Calculating, wicked, and cold, Douglas' psychotic husband character is one that instills fear but an odd degree of sympathy as he is a man who is being cheated on. This confusion - largely brought on by him being the protagonist - is exemplified by Douglas who plays this charismatic charmer so well that we half forget he is also a murderous psychopath. As his wife, Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her stronger performances. As she begins to piece together what happened to her, you can see the gears turn in Paltrow's head as well as you can see the denial and the emotion she feels as she comes to this shocking realization: both men she was with were liars and possible killers. It is a chilling place to be in for her and Paltrow sells this woman's confusion and emotion incredibly well."", ""However, what does hold the film back is its cliches and its contrivances. For the latter, the inclusion of David blackmailing Steven in the end and threatening to expose him does bring the film home to some degree, but feels overly written. Similarly, lines of dialogue dedicated to David rubbing in the fact he is sleeping with Emily come as cheesy and rather gross, highlighting that the film though thrilling may not be the best written film ever released. In fact, it is a film that tries to do too much."" ]";5

Written by and starring Nia Vardalos as 30-year-old Greek virgin who is expected to find a nice Greek boy to marry and have kids, the film is an uproariously funny work with sharp wit and great cultural jokes about Toula's (Vardalos) painfully large and Greek family. With a wedding around the corner to American white boy Ian Miller (John Corbett), the Greek family behind Toula must grow to accept this non-Greek into the family over the course of the film's 90 minutes, all while celebrating their Greek heritage throughout. Though perhaps not a great piece of filmmaking, My Big Fat Greek Wedding shows that two things are true: real life is often funny enough on its own and writing what you know yields phenomenal results when done right."", ""As a comedy about a wedding and an obnoxious family, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is not exactly a deep work. There are some light themes that emerge, but they seem to just pop up out of the circumstances shown in the film, instead of any actual purposeful intent. For example, themes about assimilating into a culture you are unfamiliar with or having to accept the unfamiliar person into your world are both discussed at length due to Ian joining the family, but these are hardly major developments or revelations. Plus, as a comedy, this fish-out-of-water element is played more for comedy than any semblance of thematic nuance. That is not an issue, mind you, but this is certainly not a film with a lot of substance. Rather, it is one that exists purely to entertain and make you laugh, which makes it a tough film review to rate. At which point does one recognize there are faults in this film - the televisual feel that is pervasive in the film and the bad acting, namely - and still recognize that the film nailed all of its stated goals."", ""Personally, I prefer to head towards the latter when it comes to films such as this. Consistently funny, smarted scripted, and capable of making fun of a culture in the way that only those who are a part of that culture can, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is an absolutely hysterical film. It is one of those few films that nails jokes throughout with no sign of letting up. Often times, these joke-a-minute films start to lose steam at a certain point, but this never does by retaining the same wit throughout, as well as the correct running gags (Windex). As a romance film, the \""meet cute\"" moments are cliche to be sure, but still effective in putting a big, goofy smile on your face. It is a cheesy and sugary romance, but rings with authenticity and realism due to the problems faced by this cute couple in advancing their relationship to marriage. Never overstaying its welcome with the comedy or the romance, the short runtime allows the best moments of both to stay in with the film feeling rather stream-lined and focused, never straying into subplots or bloat that could have rendered it a far worse film."", ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a quintessential example of using the romantic comedy formula to your advantage with a funny, smart, and cheesily romantic work. It may be predictable and cliche, but it shows why those cliches became cliches in the first place. A charmer from beginning to end, the film is a guiltless pleasure."" ]";5

Off-the-wall and truly odd, 24 Hour Party People is both a compelling biopic of Tony Wilson, the man behind Factory Records, a film about the bands who he worked with, and a film about the Manchester music scene. Told in a news broadcast fashion thanks to Wilson's background as a reporter, the film frequently breaks the fourth wall to tell its tale and blends fact with fiction (while letting you know which is which along the way). Aside from the great music and the backgrounds behind it all, the film is a truly compelling drama that also tosses in some comedy that hits fairly often. Now, of course, this is a film that will not be for everyone. It is quite oddly told and its glorification of the era may rub some the wrong way, but as it stands, it is a truly vivacious and frenetic film that captures the drug-induced haze of the era, as well as its pure brilliance."" ]";5

With a strong performance from Mel Gibson in the lead role, Signs is an incredibly well crafted science fiction thriller that does provide many answers, to the chagrin of many viewers, but I loved it. Plus, the emotional drama and personal trauma were both well handled and given the appropriate weight in the film. Together with the suspense, they combined to make a well told and truly engaging film. Additionally, the direction from Shyamalan is very good. Not only is it tense, but it is well paced and well told. He knows how to create suspense and thrills and does it here with incredible ease.

Largely well-written, the film stars Will Smith as Chris Gardner. A man who is coping with his wife leaving him, raising a son, and being homeless, Chris partakes in an internship program to become a stock broker. A real life fairy tale, The Pursuit of Happyness shows the American dream coming true with Chris working hard and being rewarded for this effort. While it is sentimental and safe along the way, it is hard to deny that the film is often incredibly powerful and thoroughly engaging throughout."", ""Pairing Will Smith with his son Jaden in the lead roles, one of the greatest assets of the film is the father-son relationship. In the role of the son, Jaden Smith is adorable. With childish jokes and innocent confusion over their situation, he turns in a shockingly solid performance here that makes you both smile and fight back tears at times. Yet, the true powerhouse here is Will Smith. Expertly portraying the down-on-his-luck Gardner, Smith is incredible in this film. Turning in a determined and emotionally vulnerable performance, Smith shows that he is more than just an action hero. He certainly does utilize his natural charisma in the film, but at all times, his performance feels achingly authentic and realistic. He may be charismatic, but you know that a broken man is just below the surface."", ""As has been said before, the film's plot greatly resembles classics such as The Bicycle Thieves. Though a true story, the film's narrative and plotting fit closely to the rags to the riches formula, which makes the story itself quite predictable. When things can get worse, they do. However, the film will always wind up happy because he has to become rich at some point. Thus, the film's story represents some pretty typical writing. Fortunately, as mentioned before, the writing's greatest strength is its characters. With the father and son duo incredibly well-rounded characters, the film is elevated significantly. The wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), is not really explored, but this is also not her story. She is a supporting part and we never see her thought process because the film is about her husband. Thus, it is not really an oversight of the film. As such, as a character study, The Pursuit of Happyness is incredibly successful as it creates characters that are easy to root for and then it drops you inside their mind. As a result, significant pathos is evoked when seeing a man who works so hard to try and better himself and his child suffer mightily."", ""Sweet and sentimental, The Pursuit of Happyness is not a great film. It is an easy watch that is guaranteed to move you as a result of Chris Gardner's story. Will Smith brings charisma and emotion to the role, while bringing along a great relationship with his son Jaden to the film. Together, the duo help to elevate the film above the Hallmark/Lifetime trappings of the story into a very successful and entertaining piece of entertainment. While cliched and predictable, the film never ceases to be engaging and rise above the cliches through the aforementioned acting and great characters."" ]";5
1429;ravenous;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""It is through films such as Antonia Bird's Ravenous that one is forced to question whether film criticism is really needed or not. Is there a way to truly qualify just how good or bad this film is? Even if there is, there certainly can be no way to truly tell if a reader would enjoy a film such as Ravenous. On an evaluation of its quality, Ravenous is pretty much best defined as \""what the **** When it comes to whether or not to recommend it to somebody, it is best to stay away from that temptation. On a similar note, there is really no way to truly enjoy this, right? Ravenous is hardly the most disturbing film ever made, but its unique blend of comedy, horror, and suspense, is often thrilling, horrifying, and funny, yet just so distasteful that it is hard to truly come away saying it was a great time. The only thing certain about Ravenous is that it made the 20th Century Fox executives who greenlit this project start sprucing up their resumes right after the first screening."", ""Perhaps the best quality presented by Ravenous that tilts it towards being a definitively good film is the score from Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn. Pulsating, thrilling in its own right, and truly unsettling, this constant within the film is really what defines the experience of watching Ravenous. Constantly keeping you on edge with each pounding hammer of a note, the film's score is one that perfectly sets the tone for the events on display. While the cannibalism would unsettle you in its own right, the score takes it a new dimension. It makes bone shatteringly unsettling, frightening, and horrifying. Yet, what is oh so brilliant about Ravenous is how it often allows the score to do the talking. As Captain Boyd (Guy Pearce) races through the woods trying to find Colonel Ives / F.W. Calhoun (Robert Carlyle), the score races through the woods alongside them, creating an atmosphere of pure, pulse-pounding tension. This type of suspense via such a horrifying score is one mastered by a select few horror films and it is one that director Antonia Bird is impressively able to keep as a constant throughout, never letting up on the gas and instead constantly ramming it down the audience's throat, proving that often times the best tension is the kind that cannot be cut with a knife, but rather made into a stew."", ""Where the film further increases its appeal is in its cinematography. Often taking on the style of a western - especially given its setting and the fact that it is about a  group of soldiers at a remote outpost - Ravenous' beautiful imagery of the snow landing on the horizon is often quite gorgeous, as is the shot of approaching members of the army as they come to investigate the happenings at the fort. Combined with the far more intimate and close-up shot of Boyd and Private Reich (Neal McDonough) investigating the cave that is lit solely by candelight, Ravenous is a film that often has terrific beauty. For all of the gore and horror on display, Bird never loses sight of the fantastic scenery around them or the haunting possibilities of the perfect lighting in a remote cave where cannibalism is known to have occurred. With this perfect framing and lighting when needed, Ravenous is a film that often truly captures the attention of the eye even when the mind is so unspeakably repulsed by the fact that these men are eating one another."", ""Where the film does slack, however, is in how conventional it can be at times. Playing with classic film tropes of protagonists not being believed by those in power or of the \""they are never dead even if you see them dead\"" horror trope, Ravenous feels very been there, done that in its structure even if its events often cover up this fact. Via the return of Calhoun as Colonel Ives or the resurrection of Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones), Ravenous is often a rather contrived film that has very little originality in how it is structured narratively. This is particularly true of its characters with the outsider Captain who is disliked by his superiors, the mysterious stranger who may or may not be trusted, the kooky soldier, the dedicated soldier, the scared soldier/preacher, and the quirky colonel. None of them feel particularly fresh, even if Bird has a lot of fun bringing this odd blend of comedic characters into a horror film. While the film is enjoyable, funny, and thrilling, it is hard to come away not thinking that its cannibalism is not a bit of a gimmick to distract from how conventional and cliche it is written. Rarely as daring as it believes itself to be, Ravenous is a film that is pretty glossy on the inside but only to hide the often rough interior work."", ""As a satire and comedy, Ravenous is certainly quite funny and a smart film. Though it is certainly about the military and Manifest Destiny to some degree, the film plays closer to a morality tale regarding sin and temptation."" ]";5

The look and feel of the film is also really well done and the second half of the film is fantastic. In addition, the special effects are well done and the story, though slow forming, is very well put together and engrossing. However, on the negative side, the first half is iffy for me. As we are introduced to this futuristic world with no murders, the explanations and presentation of everything is spotty at best, leaving the viewer a tad confused and, at times, bored.

1431;volver;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Starring a crazy, but close and fractured Spanish family, this one hit me pretty good. Though my family is not Spanish (Costa Rican, so they do speak the language), this film explores sexual abuse, death, and loneliness. Though my family does not have a history of sexual abuse (as far I know), the elements regarding the death of Irene (Carmen Maura) and her return to care for her sister and how she appears to her daughters to tie up loose ends, is entirely moving. On my Costa Rican side, the one I am far closer with, my mother and her seven sisters lost their mother back in the 1990s. I do not remember her, but they often speak of her, the food she made, and how she will often appear to them in dreams. As far as I know, she is not appearing to right any wrongs, but all the same, I can see the parallels. Similarly, most have had some rough histories with men from abuse, adultery, or pure laziness. Thus, the complaints regarding abuse (sexual in the film) and adultery by the women in this film also further hits home. All told, Volver was a film made for my enjoyment and Pedro Almodovar knocked it out of the park. My second film from him, this is a welcomed film after All About My Mother was good, but left me feeling cold. Volver is very much the opposite with brilliant direction, acting, and a heartfelt and thoroughly moving story."", ""Part magic realism, tragedy, and farce, Volver has a bit of an absurd plot at times, but can be boiled down to: a woman, Irene, comes to visit her two daughters, Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) and Soledad (Lola Duenas). Initially taking care of her dying sister (her daughter's aunt), Irene is here to make amends with Raimunda. Though she was always tight with Soledad, Raimunda had drifted away from her in her teens for reasons unknown to her. However, upon Irene's death, she learns why and shows up to make amends. Initially nervous to see her, Raimunda eventually finds out her mother is with Soledad anyways and what ensues is a phenomenal finale to the film. The final quarter of the film is the strongest section without question as it is the most emotional portion. In particular, the final line where Raimunda is excited to have her mother back and finally gets to talk to her, absolutely ruined me. Thinking of my mother and aunts when they merely get to see their mother in a dream, it was very easy for me to fall in love with this section of the film and the film as a whole."", ""This power of the mother-daughter relationship is the real strength of this film. While watching the scenes in the restaurant between Raimunda and the film crew, I was confused as to how it played into the film as a whole. Obviously, there is great comedy as there is someone hidden in the freezer in the back, but her success and camaraderie with the crew does not add much. That is, of course, until she decides to sing. In the scene with the musicians on the crew and her singing a song that her mother taught her, while her mother is hiding from her in a car, is incredible. Moving, emotional, and powerful, the emotion is clear on both the faces of Cruz and Maura. They really nail this scene and make it one of the most powerful definitions of the relationship between two. Even more, the song itself is about the memories and pain a person carries with them at night that keeps them awake. The connection to the plot and hidden pasts of the characters is clear, which makes the song a tremendous selection and the scene as a whole becomes truly wondrous."", ""In full transparency, I always love films about death. I am probably weird, but they are always so moving and powerful. Volver is no exception and underscores why good films about the subject work so well. The film underscores the feelings of loneliness, grieving, and healing, people go through. The film also really underscores the beauty of life, in spite of pain, and the beauty of death, in spite of the reason. Death is not be feared, but here, it shows this odd beauty as well as the darkness it can create, or turns it into comedy. This may seem odd, but it does work quite well for Volver and Almodovar assures that the moments are given their due weight."", ""After not loving my first entry in his filmography, Volver made me understand the love for Pedro Almodovar. Moving, emotional, and powerful, Volver's great accomplishment is its mother-daughter relationship, the regret, death, and lost time. Thanks to terrific acting, directing, and writing, Volver really hits home at times and is a truly tremendous experience. Though occasionally slow and a little bloated in spots, the finale and overall film make these flaws incredibly easy to look past."" ]";5
1432;roman-holiday;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Back when I reviewed La La Land, I discussed postmodernism. In particular, I discussed the concept of hyperreality. For many cities, such as Los Angeles and Paris in La La Land, the way in which they are perceived by many does not actually exist. These cities tend to be dream-like cities that people, over time, have romanticized heavily. Others can include Tokyo, Manhattan, Las Vegas, Miami, or maybe even London. These cities are ones where people have a concept of the city in their mind, but when they arrive, they realize the city of their dreams is not located there. What they imagined was this hyperreality that, in fact, was never really there. Rome, where Roman Holiday is obviously set, also meets this measure with various films and individuals romanticizing Rome to the point that the city ceases to exist. It is no longer there and what stands in its place is nothing anybody recognizes as Rome. Given that this romantic comedy is set in Rome, there is a connection between the hyperreality of Rome and their day spent together."", ""In exploring the bounds of this dream world, Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) escapes from the embassy for a night out on the town. However, some sleeping medication ensures a night turns into a day when she is found by newsman Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). Once he recognizes her, Joe hopes to score a good story out of his day with Ann, only to wind up falling for her instead. Together, the duo encounter the cops, drive mini-bikes, dance by the river, fight private security guards, and visit various tourist traps and memorials. Yet, their time together is fleeting. Ann must return to her country and duty as a princess. Joe wants to return to America. No matter how much both enjoy their time together in Rome, none of it really exists. Their relationship is one built on mutual deception and one that acts as a ticking time bomb. It must end and they must snap out of this dream world that is unlike any other experience in their life. Rome, for them, goes hand-in-hand with their dreamy day together and will, likewise, be imagined to be a far grander place than it really is under the surface of their dreams."", ""Director William Wyler and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo quickly separate their dreams from their realities with their demeanor and actions in both. For the latter, Ann sets out to do things she never gets to do. As her family and upbringing is quite conservative, she wants to let loose and have a day to herself. She cuts her hair, dances with strange men, and dresses down. She paints the town red and turns Rome into the canvas upon which her dreams have been painted and drawn out. Alongside her, Joe indulges in a dream for a better life, only to come to realize that this better life would include Ann. Through this day together, both indulge in their dream world that both know cannot and will not last long, but they make the most of their time together. In many ways, this is somewhat akin to a film along the lines of Brief Encounter or The Bridges of Madison County. Though both concern affairs, they also depict forbidden love that has a time limit. Roman Holiday has a far shorter time limit and is scandalous for different reasons, but is scandalous nonetheless."", ""In regards to their demeanor after the encounter, both are incredibly professional. They share nothing but looks with one another that imbue the passion they feel for one another akin to films such as Carol. Via nothing more than a look, the two show their passion and nostalgia for another, though both recognize that the relationship is not meant to last. Thus, there is no need to pretend otherwise. Furthermore, this finale that lacks a climactic romantic overture shows a direct influence on La La Land. Not only does that film often define itself by simple looks by its lovers, but it also tears them away from one another and leaves us waiting for Ann or Joe to go running after their love. Yet, that moment never comes and they go their separate ways. Naturally, Roman Holiday's finale is likely also influenced by Casablanca, as was La La Land's. Their relationship is not built to last and is best to remain in the dream world of Rome. Testing it out in a non-dream world would provide enough strain to tear them apart as they would feel their heart calling them away from that whom they love. This separation between dreams and reality is further established by the photos being returned to her and by Ann remaining tight-lipped to her servants. There is no record of what happened and nobody is speaking about anything. It will instead live on in their hearts and minds before it reaches the point where all parties begin to even wonder if it happened at all or if it were merely just a dream from a better world."" ]";5

It feels as if we know every character by the end and everything they all say is pitch perfect.

Set in the 1942, the French resistance runs operations against the Nazis that either outright fail, fizzle out, are aborted, or are minor victories. There is no climax or crescendo to these depictions. There is no honeymoon period with director Jean-Pierre Melville leaving no time for those in the resistance to lick their wounds or reveal in victory, instead dumping them in the next situation. There is no telling what will come around the bend for those in the resistance, instead they are doomed figures restricted to hiding in the shadows and await their own demise, all while fighting for the future of a Nazi-less France. Powerful, solemn, tragic, and cold, Melville's Army of Shadows continues to find supporters due to its stirring depiction of men and women uniting to fight for their country with no expectation of success, reward, or glory. Instead, they do it because they must, if their children are to ever know freedom."", ""Criticized for glorifying Charles de Gaulle by French critics in 1969, Army of Shadows wound up getting forgotten and only received an American release in 2006. The odd part, of course, is that De Gaulle is in one scene and, if anything, the film does anything but glorify the resistance. They are the heroes of this tale, yes, but Melville is entirely honest about the resistance. These are not wholly good men or women. Their cause may be a valid and heroic one, but their means and willingness to kill those who inform on them certainly calls into question just how truly \""good\"" the members of the resistance are. Pitted against the Nazis, it is impossible to not root for the resistance, but Melville never shies away from those seedy elements that show the duality of evil on both sides of this conflict. Just because one side has a good cause does not mean all of the evil done in the name of the cause is entirely justified. While Melville himself had experience fighting with the resistance, even he recognize that the means used by the resistance were not always savory and worthy of praise, even if their cause was one in which he fully believed."", ""With cold, flat blues and grays adorning the film, it is impossible to not come away believing this to be a solemn and melancholy work. It thrills and keeps the viewer hooked, but beats you down with unrelenting bleakness. While these men and women lay their life on the line every day to free France from the Nazis, one thing is absolutely certain: they will all die. They are operating on a set clock that, at any moment, could end with them being caught and tortured. As a result, perhaps the only possible future for them that gives them any sense of relief or bliss is their ability to commit suicide via a cyanide capsule when they are caught. None of these characters live to see France liberated, nor do they expect to be able to see this event. Rather, they fight to advance that possibility and open the doors for others to finish what they have started. In many ways, their mission is just an elongated suicide mission. It is hopeless and it will kill them, but is more valuable to their country and fellow man than words could ever hope to describe."", ""Perhaps the most prevalent theme in the film is just how difficult it is to truly resist an oppressive government such as the Nazis. It is in this depiction that Army of Shadows reveals just how little it seeks to romanticize its heroes. Showing them murder people or escape capture just to put themselves in a position to have success on a mission, something inevitably goes wrong for this band of rebels. No matter what they do, no matter how perfectly thought out and executed, there is always some extenuating circumstance that necessitates their retreat or aborting of the mission. In large part, this is due to the overwhelming presence of the Gestapo. Like a band of stormy weather bearing down an unwilling city, it does not matter how prepared you because they will engulf you eventually. The resistance can hide in any number of shadows they want to, but the Nazis will always be right around the corner ready to arrest them, torture them, and let them wither away in a cell.

Directed and written by Scott Frank as his directorial debut after a successful career as a screenwriter beforehand, this one is certainly very well written and he certainly directs it very well. The story is told nicely and it is fun to see everything all come together after being set up. Certainly a very emotional film, The Lookout benefits greatly from strong acting performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeff Daniels, and Matthew Goode. Also, Isla Fisher's beauty is another major strength of this one, haha. The plot and backstory of Gordon-Levitt's character is touching and very interesting, really hooks you right into the film as you want to see how everything plays out. However, in spite of the film's best attempts to avoid being a run-of-the-mill heist thriller, this one does wind up being that in a way even with the interesting back story and twists to the typical elements of the genre. Ultimately, this one is a very enjoyable film that is just extraordinary in any way, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but does prevent it from being rated higher."" ]";5

It is dark, yes, but it is deeply emotional and entirely tragic, yet beautiful all the same. From the shots of the lovely Irish countryside to the interactions amongst the characters to the costumes, the film was very much a beautiful one. However, it is the acting and characterization of the characters that really help to make this film a home run. In war films, there is typically a plethora of action with little-to-no character development. However, here, we get both. We are not shielded to the carnage of war as there is plenty of \""action\"", but we also get the emotional trauma that accompanies war in the characters' interactions with one another and their families. Cillian Murphy and cast also kill their roles and really handle this one perfectly, as does the director, Ken Loach. Another strength for the film is the delicacy with which is handles the tension between the British and the Irish. Yes, the British are depicted as evil and unjust, but we are not given a romanticized version of the IRA either. Instead, we see them doing exactly what the British do, but since we are seeing the war through their eyes, we are not angered by their actions. But, by showing them doing exactly what the Brits do, especially at the end, the film allows us to realize that there is no true bad guy and both sides have rotten elements to them. Nobody is truly innocent on either side. At the end of the day though, the violence and trauma depicted effect everybody involved in the war effort, whether directly or indirectly. A beautifully tragic film, The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a very good film. It is not a great one, but it is hard to ask for much more from a film of this kind."" ]";5

First off, Al Pacino and Robin Williams are phenomenal. I love comedians doing roles that are completely against their type and boy oh boy did Williams do that here. He was phenomenal, creepy and unsettling all wrapped into one and he nails the role. Director Christopher Nolan shows incredible talent here as he manages to creepy a truly unsettling atmosphere that never scares you to be sure, but certainly keeps you on edge. The script is very good and the characters are very well done, to the point that you are never truly sure who is good and who is truly bad.

1441;hollywood-ending;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Honestly, I am a major Woody Allen apologist. His films always make me laugh and provide fantastic entertainment, as such they receive positive reviews. Hollywood Ending is one such film. Derided as overlong, the film tells the story of a neurotic film director who suffers from psychosomatic blindness and tries to direct his comeback film entirely blind. Featuring Woody Allen in his classic neurotic role in one of his films, the film pairs him with Tea Leoni, who plays his ex-wife and a producer that scored him his last chance. Off-kilter, funny, overlong, and not long enough, Hollywood Ending is certainly lesser Allen, but that is more a credit to his track record than a criticism of this film."", ""A critical and box office bomb upon its release in 2002, Hollywood Ending is certainly not for everybody and does not necessarily deserve a reappraisal. The main criticisms regarding its humor and its length are both fair. With less effective jokes than his best films and with his humor being divisive anyways, the mixed reception makes sense. For the most part, it does feel as though Woody is directing this very film blind as it largely runs through the same framework and characters as his past works. He is hardly reinventing the wheel here and much of the fun is simply derived from the thought of a man directing an entire film blind. This joke runs thin when the film gets closer and closer to the two hour mark and the film would have been well-served by being shorter. That said, more time spent actually showing us how the film turned out would have been incredibly entertaining and given additional context to the poor reception from test audiences and studio executives. They are repulsed, but I need to know if this is Battlefield Earth bad or just disappointing. Fortunately, this negative reception does lead to the best joke of the film regarding the French reception to the film and how critically praised it was over there. Given that the Cahiers du Cinema top 10 list is always good for including a critically panned American film, this joke really landed with me. That said, the jokes are hit-and-miss and the film's premise loses steam."", ""Fortunately, the jokes that do work are really up my alley. Classic Woody Allen jokes abound here with silly, subtle, and witty jokes combined with visual gags. The simple pleasure of watching this man try to direct while blind was entertaining on its own, as was Allen's neurotic performance. Though it is a character he has played many times now, in this case, the film was very reflexive. With the director being a demanding guy who is hard to work with, runs over budget, works with exes, and wants to use foreign cinematographers, it is hard to not compare the character to Allen himself. From what I understand, he is not nearly as neurotic as his acting persona, but all the same, the other traits stick. The end result is a film that is quite reflective on his career and the industry as a whole."", ""However, the best scenes are certainly when Val Waxman (Allen) is forced to try and hide his affliction from the studio. Stumbling around and bumping into things, the scenes wreak of desperation and highlight how much Val needs the gig directing this film. In these scenes, the commentary on the industry is also at its best with a lot behind-the-scenes moments of contract negotiations, management of talent, and working on the film. As a lover of film, I ate these scenes up and this film really show why I like showbiz films. Woody Allen knows showbiz and brings it to life in this film, even following through on the self-reflexivity of the film with a unique twist on the \""hollywood ending\"". Though not strictly happy and neat, the ending is certainly hopeful and upbeat compared to the neurosis of the rest of the film."", ""Funny and compelling, Hollywood Ending is probably just a film for Woody Allen fans. All other need not apply because it not nearly funny enough or short enough to really hit a large demographic of film fans. Yet, for Allen fans such as myself, Hollywood Ending is a fun and engaging comedy that explores the nuances of Hollywood and offers a somewhat behind-the-scenes look at how it is making a film and working alongside Allen in real life."" ]";5

At every turn, there is yet another thing that makes that suspense build and build. Jodie Foster does a typically great job in the lead and I also found myself enjoying the performance of the three robbers; Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam. Each one really represented a different type of robber, with one filling the \""lawful evil\"", \""neutral evil\"", and \""chaotic evil\"", respectively. It was interesting to see this kind of shared focus in this film between Foster and her daughter and then the three robbers as they try to figure their way out of the situation they find themselves in. Overall, this one is not too complex, but that is not problematic, as it is quite enjoyable."", """", ""My main complaint is concerned with the robbers. While I enjoyed watching them all fill the different roles of \""evil\"", the film would have been better served if either A) we never saw the robbers' faces/heard them speak or B) they were all \""chaotic evil\"".

Instead of sticking with its science fiction premise, it opts to go all slasher movie and weird on us towards the end, which is ultimately what turned me off significantly from this one. Beginning with the positives, the world created here is super intriguing and very interesting. You get the problem facing this crew and as things progress or regress on their journey, you feel excited or feel bad for them. That is very important for these types of films. In addition, the special effects are splendid and the acting from the entire, very large, cast is great. Everybody did a superb job there. The direction from Danny Boyle is alright, nothing to write home about, but I do blame him a good bit for the way this one falls apart at the end. It is a movie about people traveling to the sun, so some suspension of disbelief is required, but the ending was far too much for me. Without going off the deep end there and then using that weirdness to turn this one in a low-key slasher film, this one would have been way better. On top of that, the ending significantly dragged. The preceding, say, hour and 10 minutes were absolutely riveting and had you invested in the characters, while also forcing you to the edge of your seat on multiple occasions. By the time that last half hour kicks in, you just want it to be over. However, I will say, the absolute end of this one saves the preceding half hour by being very moving and leaving the viewer on the brink of tears. Thus, it saddens me even more that, towards the end, this one burned up in the sun or else it could have been far better. It had the pieces, but what it did with those pieces was not to my liking."" ]";5

With films that take some twists and turns that are pretty unexpected, the success of the story rests on whether these are expected or not. In this case, they most certainly were not to me, though I would love to watch this one again and try to pick up on those clues. Not horror in the typical sense, this one has a way to get into your mind and mess with it a little bit, but to me, this one is not horror. Sure, after watching it, you kind of feel as though you watched a horror film, but this one struck me as more of a thriller with some elements from horror.

Featuring awful acting and even worse special effects and writing, the original Star Wars film seems to be the basis for the prequel trilogy, as Attack of the Clones has some awful, awful writing (particularly the cringeworthy romance scenes) and some bad sequences of CGI. However, I will say that the special effects on the whole are vast improved. The acting, while not good, is nowhere near as bad as it was in the original. The original felt like amateur hour. In this one, you can tell these people are professionals, while is good. The action sequences in Attack of the Clones are all very good and the fight choreography is vast improved when compared to its predecessors.

His performance honestly floored me and, while he clearly defined himself as the antagonist and pure evil, I could not help but root for him to some very small degree. Beyond the acting, the action was really well done and, throughout, the suspense and intensity of those situations and the non-action sequences were definite pros for this film. The characterization of everybody was very well done as well. The film was just two hours, but managed to go into shocking detail on all of the major players and that really impressed me. Another pro was the sets, costumes, and cinematography. All of those worked really well to encapsulate the time period and the cinematography really provided some \""classic Western shots\"" that were as beautiful as always. I really have a thing for the cinematography in westerns and this one is a great example of that beauty.

With this one, Spielberg truly proves his skill when it comes to science fiction, as well as making his films a ton of fun.

Identified as the best Dutch film of all-time by the Dutch themselves, it is not hard to see why Verhoeven's film has become so praised. With his trademark sexual exploitation and neck spurting violence, Black Book is a thrilling and suspenseful WWII thriller that constantly defies expectations with its portrayal of betrayal and the improbable allies and enemies made by our hero. Set in the final day of Nazi occupation of Holland, the film is neither damning nor sympathetic to either side and Verhoeven finds a balance in the war, opting instead to tell the story of one incredible woman."", ""With Carice van Houten starring as Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries, Black Book is already off to a good start as Van Houten turns in a characteristically terrific performance. Subdued, sensual, and manipulative, Van Houten is a perfect fit for the sexuality demanded by Verhoeven's lead characters. She also handles herself in the dramatic scenes incredibly well, being both emotionally available while never crying. You can see what she has seen and had happen to her has a deep emotional impact, but on the outside, she is a rock and ready to take on all comers. This power and strength is a positive trait of the character and one that Van Houten exemplifies at all times. Though the men in the film are obsessed with her breasts and she is constantly having them exposed, an act that would theoretically establish her as subservient to the men leering at her nude body, she retains power and control of the situations she finds herself in. Of course, men do rescue her in the film, but at all times, she is ten steps ahead of the men in the film and always capable of fighting back."", ""Interestingly, the film finds ethical people on both sides. Sent to become the girl of Captain Muntze (Sebastian Koch), Rachel/Ellis quickly discovers that he is a decent man who, in spite of his crimes he has committed, wants to see an end to the bloodshed. Though he should pay for his crimes, he is not as evil as other Nazi leaders and wants the war to end as soon as possible. He also truly loves Ellis and refuses to give her up, even upon finding out that she is a Jew. On the flip side, she becomes enemies with people on the resistance side who are actually collaborators with the Nazis and have betrayed the resistance consistently in order to become rich. It is this ethical relativism that makes Black Book stand out from the crowd in WWII films. Though films such as Stephen Daldry's The Reader have tried to paint a Nazi guard as sympathetic, it did so through the guise of having her engage in a pedophilic relationship with a young man. Black Book, fortunately, does not take this approach. Instead, it humanizes him through his love and stances taken in favor of Ellis, much to his detriment with the Nazis. He is a simple man who loves collecting stamps and is not the monster the Dutch perceive him to be. By the time the film ends, his death is one that is greatly mourned by Ellis and the audience alike."", ""The action sequences and moments of suspense are equally well handled by Verhoeven. We know he knows how to make a great action set piece through his work on RoboCop or Starship Troopers and Black Book is no exception. Brilliantly filmed, choreographed, and exuberant action scenes both thrill and instill great awe throughout the film as the men weave through the Nazi headquarters and the streets of Holland. Of course, one of the great flaws in many war or pseudo war films is its characters. Here, this is true as many characters blend together or are underdeveloped, such as staunch Christian Theo (Johnny de Mol). Now, the counter argument is that this is Rachel/Ellie's film and her story, which is fair. That said, the sprinkles of characterization we receive for everybody else is often not sufficient. Fortunately, the film does enough to highlight key motivations and traits of important players that foreshadow and drops hints for the audience to pick up on that play key roles later on."", ""A thrilling, unpredictable, and greatly dramatic WWII thriller, Black Book finds that director Paul Verhoeven still knows sex, violence, and thrills, and can find ways to make these feel unique and thoroughly engaging. At every turn, Black Book is a great exercise in ethical relativism and a terrific look at the Nazis reign of terror in Holland the betrayal that ensued across the country and across Europe in the wake of occupation."" ]";5

What that tale is truly about is diverse, as it feels like this film is simply about rejection and life as a whole. Life is unfair and senseless with Todd Solodnz having serious contempt for that harshness and the unlevel playing field we all face. A truly hollow viewing experience, Storytelling is a tough film to assess simply because it just leaves you feeling defeated and empty above all other feelings."", """", ""The theme of rejection is quite clear from the get go, in both the \""fiction\"" and \""non-fiction\"" sections of the film.

As a result of this rejection, Marcus dumps his classmate girlfriend Vi (Selma Blair) who then goes on to having violent, rapey sex with Mr. Scott.

With a deep anger towards this harshness, Solodnz lashes out by demonizing Mr. Scott in the \""fiction\"" section and killing Scooby's family in the \""non-fiction\"" (note how Consuela kills them, who is looked down upon by the family). Both sets of characters resoundly reject those around them, are incredibly priviledged and prejudiced, while also being self-obsessed and narcissistic."", """", ""This ties into the unfairness of everything in the film. In the \""fiction\"" section, Marcus is a kid trying to overcome his disease, yet faces obstacles at every turn and feels like a failure. Vi is raped, yet nobody believes her and writes her off as a racist. In the \""non-fiction\"" section, Scooby is mocked for being lost. Toby is written off as a loser, even by the audience. Brady (Noah Fleiss) is a relatively nice kid, yet he winds up in a coma after a freak football accident. Consuela (Lupe Ontiveros), the Livingston's family housekeeper, is fired simply because the Livingston's youngest son Mikey (Jonathan Osser) is a privileged and spoiled jerk who seems unable to feel any empathy whatsoever. This, of course, comes after Consuela's son is executed after being on death row. Maybe he deserved it, but Consuela certainly did not. Throughout the film, Solodnz is obsessed with examining unfairness and this unlevel playing field through the eyes of the disenfranchised, physically disabled, and the misunderstood. In many ways, these mirror himself as his films have often been written off by critics or simply misunderstood. Fortunately, Solodnz will not lash out by killing them all, but they should take this film as his letter of contempt."", """", ""As a film, Storytelling is incredibly well-written, creating engaging characters left and right. Both the \""fiction\"" and \""non-fiction\"" section create characters that I want to explore more and almost regret that the film is so short. As it stands, however, the characters are well developed with little in the way of exposition. This is largely in part to Solodnz's ability to create deeply relatable characters and trust in his audience. He trusts us to get these people and we most certainly do at every turn."", """", ""The key to understanding Storytelling lies in Toby's documentary in my personal opinion. Many label this a comedy and Solodnz as \""cruel\"" for mocking these characters. Yet, he is simply showcasing the contempt audiences have for these characters. He presents them in an unbiased manner and begs you to feel bad for them. Yet, all we can do is laugh. This is truly tragedy at its very finest as Storytelling leaves you hollow and empty as you watch these characters pushed down and left for dead at every turn without any hope for their futures. Scooby will fail out. Toby's film will fail. Consuela will never find steady work again at her age.

While everyone was scared speechless, Randy kept things going with horror movie references or playing whodunnit with the cops.

However, as we reach the climax, though it is surprising who the killers are, they just feel like reaches.

Combining the destruction of innocence as a result of violence and abandonment with a political allegory regarding the Civil War, del Toro knows how to make a film. Billed as a horror film, The Devil's Backbone takes yet another page of the del Toro playbook by using a creepy atmosphere and elements of horror (such as ghosts) to tell a story that is not intended to scare you. Akin to later works such as Pan's Labyrinth, Crimson Peak, or The Orphange (which he produced), The Devil's Backbone explores larger topics through the use of this atmosphere and things often used in horror films. Here, del Toro comments on the Spanish Civil War. With strict and cruel leaders in charge, the abandoned children are on their own with limited movement and food. Yet, they are able to use their numbers, determination, and minds to overcome their oppressors."", ""With a creepy atmosphere, del Toro is able to create a film that plays on childish fears and misunderstandings. Largely told through Carlos (Fernando Tielve), a newly orphaned child, the film features a childlike sense of wonder and confusion at his newfound living situation. This confusion leads to fear and incredible tension that the film is able to utilize in introducing its ghost. With a good build-up with multiple bumps in the night, the film's horror elements work well, even if the film itself is never overtly scary. Had this not been a del Toro film, I would have been on pins and needles expecting a malevolent being to be haunting this orphanage. This is certainly a credit to him and the atmosphere he is able to conjure up in this film. The ghost itself has great special effects and looks the part. He adds a mystery element to this film as you begin to wonder how he came to be, but as it typical for del Toro, the explanation involves a great atrocity that had gone under-the-radar and been forgotten."", ""Politically, The Devil's Backbone finds its greatest success. Creating a parallel between the struggles of the orphans and the pains of the Spaniards under Franco, the film highlights the authoritarian nature of Franco through the oppression of the children. Abandoned and left to fend for themselves, Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega) is an intimidating figure of the children. Having injured Carlos and willing to commit atrocities in the name of gold, Jacinto is a man who was once an orphan, but has become a truly evil man. Representing Franco while the kids represent the Spaniards, del Toro shows how the country came together and, even if they were weaker and smaller, used their camaraderie and numbers to overcome their oppressor. In this way, The Devil's Backbone transcends the horror genre and instead becomes a piece of political commentary and represents del Toro's fantastical view of the Spanish Civil War through the eyes of children. In a way, this introduces themes and ideas he later revisited in Pan's Labyrinth, which I believe to be a stronger film. However, as a companion piece, The Devil's Backbone is undeniably powerful and yet another great work by del Toro."", ""Acting-wise, the film is impressive. For so many child actors, the acting is The Devil's Backbone is of an incredibly high quality. The entirety of the cast nails their respective roles and the kids bring an incredible authenticity to their roles. At all times, you believe they are going through this situation and are forced to deal with the agony of the terror surrounding them. They are able to approach the situation with the innocence and sense of imagination of a child, creating methods of coping that obscure what is actually occurring (the comics). However, in saying that, watching their innocence be shattered by the peril they face is tragic and thoroughly impactful."", ""Not really a horror film, The Devil's Backbone is more a fantastical exploration of the Spanish Civil War through political allegory and the eyes of children.

The film, when it focuses on the human element, can be incredibly touching and romantic. Throughout, the characters are well-developed and the result is a cast of people who you really identify with and feel for. However, the film takes some odd turns, namely when it comes to death and the supernatural. These feel wholly diverting and distract from the overall purpose of the film with the weight some minor characters' death is given. Additionally, disturbing scenes and elements further confuse the plot and distract from the main purpose of the film: a man taking control of his life and becoming truly happy and fulfilled. These diversions are more distractions and feel more like filler than any character defining kind of stuff. That said, there is more bad than good in The Shipping News and though it can be kind of slow at times, it is never boring and is truly satisfying on the whole."" ]";5

1457;kate-leopold;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""An inventive and charming romantic comedy with a time travelling twist, Kate & Leopold feels similar to the more recent About Time, but with less impeccable cuteness. Yet, what is lacks in cuteness is makes up for with charm from Hugh Jackman. A real life version of an internet user calling every girl \""m'lady\"", but with the plot twist of him actually meaning it, Jackman plays Leopold, Duke of Albany. Brought to 2001 from 1876 by his great grandson Stuart (Liev Schreiber), a scientist who discovered time portals, time bends and stars collide when he meets Kate (Meg Ryan). The ex-girlfriend of Stuart, Kate and Leopold quickly fall for one another, but must overcome the fact that their time period is over 100 years apart and Leopold must go back to 1876 or Stuart will not be born. Sticky stuff, really. In the vital words of Matthew McConaughey, \""Time is a flat circle\"". Kate & Leopold is the very embodiment of this."", ""Hinting at its finale - that Kate and Leopold will be together, duh - from the very first scene when Leopold notices Stuart taking photos at a party thrown to celebrate Leopold choosing a wife. As Leopold chases after Stuart, he runs past Kate at the party. How did she get there, you ask? You honestly know without watching the movie. This is the problem with these romantic comedies. They are also so predictable. Kate & Leopold is no exception and is not set to bust expectations. Its time traveling makes no sense and ill-defined, just as in About Time. But man is it ever charming. It is romantic and shows that nothing can keep people apart, but sometimes, you just have to take a leap of faith in order to land the one person meant for you. Here, Jackman and Ryan sell it hard with terrific chemistry, Jackman turning up the charm, and Ryan playing an unlikable, but soon oddly cute character in this romantic comedy. Funnily enough, the film gets a bit self-reflexive in a deleted scene added in the director's cut with Kate at a movie screening in her job as a market researcher. Complaining to the film's director that the entire test audience hated the lead because she was unlikable, he fires back that he believes she is likable, but screws up sometimes and deserves a pass for that just as Kate would get a pass. In a bit of self-reflexiveness, Kate fires back that she is not a character in a romantic comedy.  Though not a crucial scene, it is a funny bit since Kate is an unlikable character in a romantic comedy on the surface."", ""In reality, she is not unlikable at all. How would one react to hearing that a time portal was opened by your ex-boyfriend? Well, Stuart gets locked up in a mad house for spouting off that he opened a portal and both Kate and her brother Charlie (Breckin Meyer) write him off as a hardcore method actor. Kate even goes so far as casting him as a spokesman for a crappy butter company. She is a career-focused woman who gets met with pervy bosses who want her to sleep with them for promotions. Her whole day is marketing crappy products to moronic customers and she, though she spins it in her mind, is unhappy with this lifestyle. She wants more and when offered more by Leopold, it is really an offer she cannot refuse."", ""Featuring Jackman at his most charming and Ryan, coming off of some plastic surgery that made her upper lip curl up oddly and be too full (it is really distracting once you notice it) and from making romantic movies with every popular 1980s/1990s/early 2000s actor (no seriously, Tom Hanks, Denzel, Matthew Broderick, Kevin Kline, Billy Crystal, Nicolas Cage, Russell Crowe, and Val Kilmer), gets to add another popular leading man from the era to her stable. The duo making for an alluring pairing and really do work together. The are a bit of romantic foils with Leopold a hopelessly old fashioned romantic and Kate a \""masculine\"", career-focused woman who wants romance, but never thinks she will be able to find it. While not inventive here, it does work impeccably well."", ""Charming, interesting due to the time travel angle, and pairing together two equally charismatic leads, Kate & Leopold is definitely an early-2000s film. That said, it is a fun film that has some messy time travel, is cliched, and predictable, but like a good McDonald's burger with some fries and a coke, it is entirely irresistible when you are hungry."" ]";5

However, this film truly rides on atmosphere and its well-adapted script with a seriously spooky air to the film and well made characters.

Truly a masterful performance from Crowe, his performance makes the film, though the film  itself is certainly interesting. Ron Howard's direction is typically strong here and he does a good job telling the story of famed mathematician John Nash. However, where this film is most strong in terms of story is in its telling of Nash's struggle with schizophrenia. In a way, it really opens your eyes as to how it is to live with schizophrenia and suffering through the delusions associated with it. In a sense, this is one of the better films on mental disease ever made as it paints a very real, distressing, and disturbing portrait, all of which make you appreciate the genius of Nash all the more."" ]";5

For example, one describes how a girl who wished him a happy birthday will live on in his memories forever, only to then wonder when a memory expires. Lines such as these will overcome inadequacies in the film as a whole, as they transcend the medium. Instead, it makes the experience feel incredibly real and authentic. Wong Kar-wai's film may feel as though it is occurring at a distance from the audience, but lines such as these make the film realize that there is no distance at all. This is not a romance film, rather it is one about lost love and the pain it can cause. As such, it is an incredibly cold film, but not emotionless."", """", ""Stylistically, the film uses a ton of hand-held camera, if not solely hand-held. The end result is a kinetic and chaotic experience that highlights the loneliness of its protagonists. As the city and even their lives (as cops) run around hectically, their love life and home life remain empty and filled with solitude. It is always lovely when a director's style matches some element of the film and offers its own thematic elements. This is very much the case with Chungking Express. Additionally, the film is just simply very well shot. Hand-held cameras can be quite nauseating and annoying when noticeable, yet Chungking Express deftly avoids these trappings and instead utilizes the style effectively. Essentially, it is supposed to put you into the scene. The camera does this here, but certainly not always."", """", ""A thoroughly melancholy and moving experience, Chungking Express will make you feel its characters loneliness in a very human way that will more than likely break your heart. Both this and In the Mood for Love (the other Wong Kar-Wai film I have seen), both have this quality that make you think they will be a romance film and certainly play out like a romance film should, but they are anything but romance films.

Additionally, the film manages to thrill at all turns as you attempt to figure out what the jury will decide in this landmark and racially divisive case. Can a black man receive a fair trial in Mississippi? Should he be guilty regardless? A morally difficult film about vigiliantism, the film can be quite one sided and not all of the characters are well put together, but the acting and dialogue more than fix these problems. McConaughey is terrific and Samuel L. Jackson is great with a passionate and typically fiery performance as the father who exacted revenge on the men who raped his daughter. A tough watch at times, A Time to Kill showcases how the courtroom drama type of film can be done right and can be incredibly thrilling and thought provoking.

Relying largely on the fear of the unknown, the film is a major success and really keeps you on the edge of your seat as you try to piece everything together.

Often times, the film could best be described as an incredibly rich chocolate cake. For some, they enjoy lots of sugar, especially children, but certainly some adults. Other adults, including myself, get nauseous because something is too sweet. Speed Racer is often times this feel. It may be a family film, but it seemed to pour it on a little thick at times. Telling the story of Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) and his quest to clean up racing, a sport he was born into, the film is a thoroughly entertaining effort from the Wachowskis that will certainly wow anime fans, action junkies, and children, but for all others, it will be merely diverting entertainment."", """", ""An undeniable visual accomplishment, Speed Racer features absolutely killer special effects. When the humans are set against the backdrop of these special effects, it can look quite fake, though that may be intentional. That said, the Caso Cristo 5000 and Grand Prix races are so pretty and incredibly crafted, it is incredible. These sequences, when focused on the race, are tremendous. Yet, these sequences are even held back by the Wachowskis insistence to frequently have jarring cuts to announcers and the crowd with them just talking about Speed Racer kicking everyone's ass. It really kills the mood and does not entertain, but rather annoys. It is a film that has racing obsessed characters, but yet the directors seem wholly uninterested in actually showing racing during the races."", """", ""That said, the frenetic pace of the film during the races really adds to the entertainment. Without the racing, this film would be horrifically bad. Without the special effects, this film would be truly hollow, as beneath the surface, Speed Racer offers absolutely nothing. A paper thin plot that is every family movie cliche rolled into one, Speed Racer utilizes cloying sentimentality, stupid flashback montages (especially the one at the end for Racer X), and cliche parent-son conversations to reinforce the image of it being a film about family. If this were at all true, the parents would not be every parent cliche in the book. For example, Pops Racer (John Goodman) is a hard on the outside, but loves his family deeply. He loves car, working on cars, and can be incredibly hard nosed when his wife, Mom Racer (Susan Sarandon), is not around to stop him. Mom Racer, on the other hand, exclusively cooks, serves her husband and sons, and has heart-to-hearts with her son about her pride over him and to help communicate his father's feelings to him. In other words, the characters are walking, talking cliches."", """", ""The characters continue to take nosedives in this one with Spritle (Paulie Litt) being wildly annoying. I get there has to be a kid character for kids to relate to a bit, but he is just so annoying it physically hurt. His chimpanzee companion added nothing. No humor, nothing. I think he is from the source material, but could have certainly been left out. It may be a kids movie, but why add a chimp? Do kids just like real life chimps that much? As a former kid, I can attest that this is not the case."", """", ""Speed Racer is that hot girl with no personality whatsoever. She may be fun for a while, but when you realize she has no personality worth sticking around for, you realize it may be time to move on. That said, the experience is not completely unredeemable, because hey, she is still hot and you two did have a good time together. However, for anything long-term to really work out, there has be something underneath the surface. Some kind of inner beauty. Unfortunately, Speed Racer offers none of that. Instead, it accepts being nothing but eye candy while being unwilling to offer anything. At the very least, it is better than Jupiter Ascending which, while equally pretty, was plain dumb. Speed Racer is a kids movie, so most stupid moments I can write off for that reason and give it a pass. Overall, stick around for the visuals because they make this one worth a watch."" ]";5

Other zombie films have focused on the former element with and the real underbelly of society, I Am Legend introduces enough to the latter element in order for it to be a worthy addition to the genre."", """", ""Many have unfavorably compared this film to 28 Days Later, due to the evil and anguish portrayed in that film, but that is unfair. Though they are of the same genre, I Am Legend attempts to do more. Instead, of instilling more desolation, it attempts to develop hope, which is admirable. From what I understand, this is unfaithful to the novel, but having never read the novel, I do not really care. Plus, I love The Shining, which is nothing like the novel. Thus, faithfulness to the novel is irrelevant to me when discussing a film. As it stands, the film's exploration of hope and faith in a better tomorrow, as well being the \""light in the darkness\"" is more in line with what I would anticipate in the aftermath of such a disaster. While may will resort to evil as in 28 Days Later, many would try to keep up hope and belief that some force - God or other - will lead them out of this trauma. Ultimately, it comes down to how one grieves and handles strife. Essentially, I Am Legend showcases a different form of handling conflict and executes it very well, particularly evident in the final quote and the actions of Robert Neville (Smith)."", """", ""The film really shines, however, in the characterization of Neville as the last man on Earth. The loneliness, destitution, and companionship with his beloved dog, Sam, are all traumatic and difficult to watch. The way in which he tries to talk to a female mannequin and talks casually to other mannequins is heart watching and, in my mind, perfectly captures this isolation one would feel if trapped in such a scenario."", """", ""In terms of thrills, I Am Legend more than delivers with its fair share of heart attack inducing sequences. That said, a lot of these thrills seem to capitalize on poor decision making from Neville and his dog, which is more tedious to watch than thrilling at times. Though these scenes entertain, they do often fly in the face of the development of Neville as a smart, calculated, and thorough planner of his daily actions."", """", ""Adding to the negative, the film's special effects do leave a lot to be desired. Though I thought the depiction of the disease and general concept of the \""darkseekers\"" was well developed, the look and realization of these concepts fell short of expectations. Given that films that came out before and in 2007 had far better effects than this one, it is inexcusable for a film with such a high budget. This, to me, is the main shortcoming of the film, but together with stupid character actions that are against their personality, they add up to really hold back the film from being even better."", """", ""I Am Legend is an inspirational look at hope in the face of tremendous odds. Many criticized the addition of the religion, but it is a very apt addition given the situation. Religion exists to give people hope of a better tomorrow. In times of turmoil and anguish, many turn to religion as that \""light in the darkness\"". Thus, it makes a lot of sense for it to be added into a film of this type. Even if it not in the original novel, it is a logical thematic addition. In terms of the film, I Am Legend delivers thrills, hope, and light, but can at times be a bit tedious and suffers from bad effects. All in all, this one is more than worth a watch if you, like me, are one of the few who has not seen film from Will Smith's prime."" ]";5

It does a great job creating thrills without having to resort to guns for the most part, which is always a breath of fresh air for me. However, towards the end, it all goes off course and it really puts a damper on the movie for me. One scene in particular kind of hits the breaks and felt very, very Hollywood. Throughout all of the preceding elements, this one felt very realistic, which is what really contributed a lot to the thrills provided, but the ending, again, kind of kills that a bit for me.

Until today, the only time I had seen any portion of a Harry Potter film was, I believe, this film in the car of a friend that had a dvd player in their parents car. It absolutely terrified me, rendering this a franchise that would get put off for a long time. Add in some parental worry regarding the depiction of witchcraft and it was obvious that this was not a franchise I would see as a child. As an adult, however, this became an inevitability and, well, the time has come. In this first entry into the series, The Sorcerer's Store is a Spielbergian film with a great sense of wonder, magic, and a child-like view of the world in which it inhabits that makes it a true expression of childish glee and joy, even when it can become quite cheesy and a bit hokey."", ""Those cheesy and hokey bits come at a few moments that can certainly be pin-pointed at the real lowlights of the film. The first is the Quidditch sequence. In 2001, the special effects in that scene were bad and they are somehow even worse in 2017. The flying as a whole is often quite rough, but the prolonged Quidditch scene is the most obvious portion that really fails to live up to expectations, especially because it is so long. Another bit that was a bit cheesy and cliche is the first act of the film. With young Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) dumped with his aunt and uncle after the death of his parents, he is constantly emotionally abused by his family with them constantly favoring their own son, Dudley. The exaggerated and cringy behavior of the family really never lands. It makes the audience hate the aunt and uncle, as they should, but it feels inauthentic and derived from a child's hyperbolic belief of how his guardians raise him, except it is all true. Overwrought and an entirely cliche way to introduce us to this magical world of wizardy, the opening is a rather pedestrian start to the beloved franchise. Finally, the ending is similarly pedestrian with the House of Gryffindor coming from behind after some last minute point additions. It is too much like a classic sports movie with the cliche of the protagonist team always snatching victory out of the jaws of defeat at the hands of the enemy - House of Slytherin, which includes Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and is led by Snape (Alan Rickman) - to really work. It is too happy and cheerful for a film that had already ended happily. Letting Gryffindor lose in the first year would have been a nice touch, as it gives them room to grow even in the game of Quidditch and not just as wizards."", ""Aside from those issues, however, it is hard to rely find fault in the first foray into the world of Hogwarts and magic. Potter is a modern icon for a reason: his story is damn captivating. With a Spielbergian sense of wonder - just see Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) ride in on a bike akin to E.T. for how Spielbergian it becomes - The Sorcerer's Stone always delivers the goods. It delves into this world of wizardy just enough without ever diving into full-on exposition, instead it sprinkles in mythology every so often to really wet your palette. The refusal to divulge every secret of this world really keeps you hooked in and aching for the next installment to the series in order for more of those questions to be answered and more magical doors unlocked."", ""What makes the film so undeniably charming, however, has to be the cast. With young Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, leading the way, this deeply British cast always makes the film incredibly appealing. Though child actors, the trio of young leads strike the right balance between childish earnestness and strong acting. They retain that confused innocence of their situation - especially Radcliffe throughout, particularly before he gets to Hogwarts - without ever letting their performances devolve into truly annoying childhood roles. Alongside them, the reliable cast of elders deliver excellent performances. John Hurt is delightful in a brief appearance as the wand salesman. Maggie Smith nails her role as the headmistress, really possessing the right look and demeanor for a nice, but expectant headmistress. Richard Harris is lightly used as Dumbledore, but nonetheless a positive and friendly presence. However, nobody really nails their role like Alan Rickman. Reserved, cold, calculating, and menacing, he plays Snape like a villain and makes Harry's confusion regarding Snape's intentions all the more believable. Whenever on screen, Rickman steals the show."" ]";5

With a \""girly\"" writer as the basis of this club, the main draw here is the feel good nature, the relationships, and the tearjerking happiness of it all. As with many chick flicks, it is sappy, unoriginal, predictable, and simplistic. Yet, it is equally irresistible. It is filled with joy, easy to watch, funny, and sweet. With solid characters, fun references to Austen's work, and a largely infectious atmosphere, it is admittedly hard to enjoy this film without having read Jane Austen. That said, I have not read her novels, but have watched some of the films. Close enough?"", ""Starring a large cast including Maria Bello, Emily Blunt, Kathy Baker, Hugh Dancy, Amy Brenneman, Jimmy Smits, Maggie Grace, and Marc Blucas, the film depicts women going through a variety of marital issues. From adultery, to lust, to young love, to no love, to loneliness, The Jane Austen Book Club goes through everything you can think of when it comes to relationships. However, its greatest achievement is its characters. Authentic, real, and well developed for having so many of them, it is the characters that allow the film to be successful and to have a satisfying pay-off at the end. The acting goes hand-in-hand with this with solid performances across the board. In particular, Bello is great. Portraying a woman who has given up on love and accepted that she is meant to be alone, she is very good in bringing to life this woman who has this element of her awoken when she meets a man."", ""That said, the film is imperfect. Certainly incredibly neat with a cheesy happy ending, The Jane Austen Book Club may create realistic characters, but it avoids realistic relationships in fear that it may become too unhappy. Now, the film uses this bubbly happiness to make solid jokes and parallel the work of Austen and the jokes often work. The film also is decidedly pro-female and anti-male. A man cheats on his wife, an awful act, and he is looked down upon. A woman contemplates sleeping with a high school boy who she teaches and it is her husband's fault for not reading Jane Austen and for not fighting his boss over a business trip. Now, since it is a chick flick, these moments are negligible and to be expected. That said, it did feel particularly egregious here. The film's portrayal of its lesbian characters is also a little awkward, opting for titillating over realistic. That said, the characters are better written than many other lesbians and treated very fairly by other characters in the film. However, the closing shot of them having sex and the camera panning down a woman's body seems to be focusing on making it arousing, rather than simply a regular act."", ""That said, The Jane Austen Book Club is a pretty inoffensive, safe, and by-the-book chick flick. Fortunately, it feels lively, fun, and is thoroughly enjoyable enough to make the cliches it follows feel fresh. With good performances, authentic characters, and a great blend of the work of Austen in a modern setting, the film should appeal to fans of the legendary author. I imagine that finding references, similar characters, or similar situations, would prove to be a fun exercise for serious fans of Jane Austen. For non-fans, the film is still greatly rewarding. While a palatable chick flick for men, it is also funny, sweet, and incredibly effective at making you smile at the end."" ]";5

This praise is certainly very fair. As with the rest of the film, it shows signs of its low-budget indie status, but cinematographer Tim Orr does a terrific job in this film.

Instead, Orr moves the camera with confidence and with the skills of a true professional."", """", ""As for the writing, this is where the film really shines. With believable characters who also happen to be incredibly relatable, Green does a great job developing his characters and giving them appropriate responses to the challenges that arise throughout the film. No matter what happens, they all react in ways that are certainly within their character. While the film is named George Washington, I would not say that George Richardson is the only kid with any development. Instead, the whole cast of characters is given background without any exposition. Instead, it just shows you and trusts its audience to understand that this is who the character is and where they come from. Coming from the day and age in which exposition is king, George Washington is a true breath of fresh air in that regard."", """", ""That said, the voice-over can be a bit much and is the main detraction from an otherwise very good film. Often a little wordy, the voice-over is delivered by a 12-year old girl and sounds far deeper than any 12-year old I have ever met. Thus, an incredibly believable film outdoes itself a little bit with this element as it feels as if it is very much in contrast with all of the other positives of the film. Without the voice-over and attempted depth, George Washington could have been truly great."", """", ""Overall, though it shows signs of its low-budget, David Gordon Green's slice of life film George Washington is an often moving look at youth, growing up, death, and this summer that will live on it the memories of its character for the rest of time.

Featuring a great starring turn from the always stellar Naomi Watts and great direction from Lynch, Mulholland Dr seems to be great proof that Lynch hates his audience and typical storytelling conventions, which make for a great combination in this film. One of the most confusing puzzles I have ever come across in film, Mulholland Dr has some seriously great writing and manages to have numerous moving parts that it brings together quite nicely. Not all the pieces fit and it is hard to determine what the puzzle is actually of, but there's an answer somewhere. What the answer is, I have no idea, because I have no idea what I do not know at this point. The film really manages to set you up nicely and the pull the rug right out from under you with constant twists and turns that you do not expect that makes coming to a conclusion about what you just witnessed all the more difficult. All I know is that something sinister is afoot in Hollywood in this film that feels like a nightmare from beginning to end."", """", ""*SPOILERS*"", ""The best conclusion I can come up with is just a fragment of a singular conclusion. For one, it is certainly a comment on people coming to Hollywood who are entirely idealistic and how Hollywood corrupts them, messes with their mind, and makes them entirely jaded. In Hollywood, things seem to happen at random, but rather, they are controlled by a single entity who oversees everything and determines who will have success and who will not have success. The haves and have nots are ultimately determined by who gives in to those in power. If you do, your wildest dreams will come true. However, at the end of the day, to me the key to unlocking this box (lol) is Club Silencio. From that moment in the film on, things certainly take a turn and to fully understand this one, I think that serves as a good starting point. The answer is somewhere there, but what the answer is, I have no idea."", ""*END SPOILERS*"", """", ""Ultimately, Mulholland Dr is a fun film to sit down and try to dissect.

The cinematography is also great as it really manages to perfectly capture the look and feel of old Los Angeles and, most impressively, makes this film look timeless. Honestly, it fits in perfectly with the films that came before, but could be passed off as a newer film at the same time. The story is great as well, thanks not just to the acting, but to a great script as well. The revealing of the facts from the lies in this mystery thriller is perfectly executed and makes the film extremely to watch as you try to figure out exactly what happened here. However, the only drawback here for me is the ending. I am ok with the mood they were going for, but really, the way the events transpired left me feeling unsatisfied to a degree. Now, it does not outweigh the greatness before, but I just wish the ending was a bit better for my liking. In spite of that, Chinatown is a great, near perfect neo-noir film that does not feel aged in the least."" ]";5

Okay, he embraces his weird side in every film he has ever made, but I mean, his really weird side. Light, stupid, and incredibly funny, Mars Attacks! is an riotously funny science fiction comedy that is more than in on the joke and knows actions on screen are absurd. With its tongue placed firmly in its cheek, Tim Burton's film offers more laughs than it knows what to do with, while also giving a humorous look at people's reactions to the attacks. From weirdos in Vegas to a pair of kids who were clearly prepared for the attack, the President, the military, and rednecks in Kansas, Mars Attacks! offers some political insight, but more or less settles for being tongue-in-cheek science fiction film and I was more than okay with this approach."", ""Spoofing 1950s science fiction films, Mars Attacks! features an ensemble cast led by Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J.

This cast hams it up a ton in their various roles with each of them engaging in hysterical encounters with the attacking alien forces. As for standouts among this cast, Nicholson is a big highlight in a duel role as the President and, in Vegas, as real estate developer Art Land. Offering two very different performances between the serious President and the outlandish and crazy Art Land, Nicholson is both a calming presence and a great source of dry humor in the film. Natalie Portman is also hysterical here as the President's daughter. Though incredibly young, her deadpan delivery and comedic timing make every word that leaves her mouth comedic gold. Pierce Brosnan as a cocky professor, Sarah Jessica Parker as a fashion talk show host, and Martin Short as the White House press secretary, are also highlights here."", ""Plot-wise, Mars Attacks! is pretty typical with a lot of the film focusing on determining whether or not the aliens are hostile or not. However, once they get their answer (\""spoiler\"": they are going to attack), all hell breaks loose. Burton steps on the gas, pours fire on it, and laughs maniacally as the film spirals into control. With entertaining deaths, great one-liners and gags along the way (\""they killed Congress!\""), and fun action set pieces, Mars Attacks! embraces the absurdity and has a ton of fun with it. In particular, an encounter between Martin Short and an \""attractive\"" alien is hysterical. Additionally, the running dialogue between Pierce Brosnan's severed head and Sarah Jessica Parker's head attached to a dog's body is both absurd and even more comical when considered in the context of the situation they find themselves in during the film."", ""With purposely cheap-looking aliens, the film reaches great heights as a spoof with oddly comical aliens that openly mock the science fiction genre and dedication put into making realistic looking aliens. Yet, in terms of spoofing the genre, its depiction of the United States is great. Dignified, advanced, and self-assured, the generals and President are quickly bamboozled by the aliens who use their own inventions as comedic tools (the translator running gag is great). Even better, the use of nuclear weapons being quickly embraced by the aliens is tremendous, as is the full-scale invasion of Washington DC, the use of the Washington monument, and the mayhem in the White House. All are uproariously absurd and keep making you wonder, \""Did that really happen?\"", but the answer to this question is also, unequivocally, \""Yes and it was glorious.\"" By mocking the death of a useless Congress, the ineffectiveness of the nuclear bomb, the gung-ho general, and peace-loving President and Professor, Mars Attacks! really satirizes many elements of politics and it is hard to say what side the film comes down on. At the end of the day, both the pacifists and war advocates wound up dying. If anything, Mars Attacks! seems to say, \""F*** it we all die anyways.\"""", ""With gloriously terrible computer animation, hilarious dialogue, purposely awful music (that Grandma deserves the Congressional Medal of Honor for listening to that stuff), and a lively cast who deliver their lines with the right amount of cheese, Mars Attacks! is a great comedy film. Spoofing B-movies and 1950s paranoia-laced science fiction horror, Mars Attacks! demands that its audience be willing to go along with it throughout. This does not mean shutting off your brain or anything stupid like that. Rather, its brand of humor is all its own and requires that the audience just accept this oddity that will unfold and tries to enjoy the ride. As a result, Mars Attacks! is wildly divisive, but I found myself to be firmly residing in the \""Yay\"" section."" ]";5

What plays out is them imaging their spouses' spending time with one another, as well as them imagining confronting their adulterous partners. Unfortunately for them, their spouses heavy travel schedule leaves prevents any of these interactions from actually taking place, thus leaving them in eternal limbo as they await their returns. As expected, the two fall in love and spend more and more time with one another, but repress their emotions to keep up appearances. By the film they are willing to move on their love, time has passed and they simply can no longer because together as life has brought them extenuating circumstances."", """", ""A decidedly melancholy film steeped in themes of respect and loneliness, In the Mood for Love only subtly pays off on its hinting at the main characters' love. Though Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan certainly hit it off and love spending time with another, the film goes out of its way to showcase the two of them maintaining their purity and not becoming their spouses. Instead, they hold themselves back and keep on just being friends. Wong does great at capturing this element as the romantic tension and longing between the two shines through in large part to the camera work and acting."", """", ""In the Mood for Love is incredibly slowly paced, which allows for the full emotional impact of their trauma and regrets to really linger with this audience. Even more, this slow, methodic pacing almost becomes wholly melodic and poetic as Wong weaves his way through this relationship, the crumbling of their marriages, and their later attempts to reconnect but to simply be kept apart. In particular, the discussion of the old method of hiding secrets and then seeing Mr. Chow do exactly as he described while in the ruins of Cambodia is a truly moving and poetic ending to the film. Yet, incredibly subtle and restrained, as is the case with Wong's characters. Plus, this scene does a great job capturing larger topics in the process. it was not just our two protagonists whose lives changed, but also all of Hong Kong. As hinted to at the end, Hong Kong has changed dramatically since they met four years prior to the end of the film. Not only have their former landlady's moved out, but times have changed and people are moving on. The fact that Wong chose to end the film in Cambodian ruins is also attached to this element, considering it is a very visual representation of the way in which time moves on and leaves destruction, ruins, and memories in its wake. The camera work in this final sequence is particularly moving as it moves through these Cambodian ruins as Mr. Chow visits them."", """", ""Ultimately, Kar-Wai Wong's In the Mood for Love is a truly tragic exercise in heartbreak, repression, and loneliness. Though these two may love one another, they simply cannot allow themselves to express this in the conservative Hong Kong. If they did, it would be the end of them socially. Thus, they remain silent.

Throughout the entirety of the film after the young college-age protagonists arrive at their cabin in the woods, it is impossible not yell out, \""USE THE AXE!\"" or \""USE THE GUN!\"" It is just one of those horror movies, I guess, where characters have weapons sitting right next to them and instead they opt to let the demon zombie continue to live and just sit right in front of them without doing anything. Nonetheless, this oddly a major part of the film's charm as a pulse pounding and thoroughly thrilling romp through the middle of nowhere while zombies possess everybody in this cabin. Luckily for them, they have the man who will become Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) at the helm, ready to discover his true calling in life: putting zombies on ice."", ""Providing scares from the moment this pack of morons find a spooky recording summoning demons from the Book of the Dead, Raimi's film consistently uses some exciting ways of spooking the audience and leaving us on edge. With the cryptic nature of that message being read as he shows us something coming to life under the soil, Raimi's film begins to fully realize the tension that had only been hinted at from the beginning. This hinting takes on the form of absolutely brilliant handheld point-of-view shots of something lurking outside of the cabin. Hanging about outside and whispering to Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) to \""join us\"", Raimi smartly leaves us in the dark as to what is awaiting these kids before we finally get introduced to the sinister evil bubbling underneath the floor boards of this cabin in the woods. It is a terrifying way to build suspense without tipping the film's hand and it is only a mere hint at how scary this film will become."", ""Through explosively campy and low-budget gore and make-up, The Evil Dead keeps the mood relatively light for how dark its plot becomes, but that does not mean it is not a horror film at its core. With tense and thrilling encounters between the kids and their now possessed friends, the film constantly shows the horror of having to kill your friends to survive, while also delivering terrific zombie scares throughout. Featuring an unsettling score that is occasionally accompanied by a truly haunting heartbeat sound and liberal usage of oblique angles when the climax arrives, The Evil Dead is a film that has no problem leaving the audience sweating what is awaiting Ash around the next corner. Compared to Army of Darkness, this initial entry into the trilogy is a lot less tongue-in-cheek and that lack of one-liners is felt when the zombies are around every corner and Ash has no idea how to finish them off. It is tense, thrilling, and an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that will leave you curling up while wondering if you need to look away or not. It is truly unbridled fun that knows it is fun, but never lets that fact obscure just how scary the film becomes."", ""As with many horror films, The Evil Dead certainly has something going on with the women in the film, namely Cheryl. The first one to get attacked by the demons, she runs in the woods (horrible idea) and gets attacked by the trees. Holding her down, ripping her clothes off, showing us a boob, and then having a tree branch penetrate her, the film quite overtly creates a rape scene. Many horror films include vaginal or penile imagery and this film is certainly no exception as that scene demonstrates. With many horror films also killing those who have sex during the course of the film, it is certainly not far-fetched to believe the two are firmly intertwined. Playing up on the typical sensuality felt when a sex scene is in a film by draping it in blood, guts, and horror, horror films manage to make the audience even more uncomfortable. It is unsettling to watch Cheryl get attacked by the trees and it is only worsened by how vulnerable she is when the trees strip her down. It seems as though there is nowhere to go as it violates it and puts a demon inside her and that inevitability at a point when she is so vulnerable and unprotected is really what makes the scene so effectively terrifying."", ""Scary and thrilling throughout, The Evil Dead lacks the comedic bite of Army of Darkness and with how bad the effects are, that may not be a good thing. However, Raimi plays it so light with some self-awareness about how dumb it all looks that it winds up remaining truly scary and yet not scarring. That said, it was probably a good idea to turn its sequels into horror comedies, if only because it plays so nicely into Sam Raimi's wheelhouse and skillet. However, as a more straight-up horror film, The Evil Dead delivers the goods in a fun and thoroughly spooky film."" ]";5

While funny and quirky to the max, its too neat ending and cliche romantic element really undermine what could have been a charming crime comedy from the legendary director."", """", ""The film's strength is in its comedy. Woody Allen plays his typical neurotic and thoroughly odd character as C.W. Briggs, an insurance investigator. When paired up with Helen Hunt, a tough-nosed efficiency expert named Betty Ann Fitzgerald, the comedy gold keeps coming.

The insults lodged at one another do sometimes miss, but for the most part, the jokes land."", """", ""The crime mystery element of this one is also solid and thoroughly unexpected. While we know who is responsible, the film does have tension as you wait for everybody to figure this out. In this way, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is a terrific example of dramatic irony. The film is 90% dramatic irony and it proves to be both funny and tense throughout. Admittedly, this is not a general plotline I have seen before where a hypnotist comes into play to this degree, but it does provide some good moments of tension, even if his plan falls through. As a criminal, his plan is obvious."", """", ""The biggest way in which the film is influenced by classic noir has to be in Charlize Theron's character. The costume design certainly shows influence, but it is clear that Theron's Laura Kensington is designed to be a femme fatale to a certain degree. She admittedly does not fit the role fully, but her makeup, hairstyling, costume, sensualness, and heavy smoking certainly made me notice the reference. That said, she does not necessarily lead her lover (Woody Allen lol) into dangerous situations, but she certainly does not help."", """", ""On the negative side, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is held back by the ending. Trying to be more romantic than it is, the romance that blossoms here is never truly believable, though wholly telegraphed. I cannot tell if they meant to hide it or not, but my guess is that it was supposed to be a surprise. Instead, it makes the ending feel truly cheesy. The ending felt incredibly rushed and things come together quite quickly and behind the scenes before we see our criminal get his just desserts. For a film that did the comedy and mystery elements so well, the shoehorned in romance and quick resolution to the crime just did not fit and made the ending feel incredibly flat."", """", ""Overall, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is an incredibly fun film. With Allen's trademark humor and his trademark character, it is an effective comedy and mystery. Largely dismissed by critics and even Allen himself as one of his worst works, I do really like The Curse of the Jade Scorpion.

Introducing us to this sadistic and surrealist world, Fire Walk With Me starts off withe murder of Teresa Banks (Pamela Gidley), the disappearance of FBI agent Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak), and then moves into the central mystery regarding the suspicious incidents happening to high school prom queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in the lead up to her death. From what I gather, her death is the mystery explored in the original television series. What is perhaps the most interesting is how little is actually revealed. Sure, we see what kills her here, but that is hardly the only bit that is important. A film that defies definition and reaches comical levels of Lynchian absurdity, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is simply a damn good time if you are a film lover who adores being thoroughly confused."", ""What is perhaps most obvious in this film is the balance between heaven and hell that Lynch creates. With references to how, once you walk with the fire, it consumes you entirely with innocence the first thing to go. Read as being in reference to hell fire or walking in sin, Laura Palmer exemplifies this by working as an apparent sex worker who goes to seedy, red-tinted dance halls with creepy men who give her drugs. In dancing with the devil in such a fashion, Laura has let her soul come into direct contact with danger that leaves her open to losing her soul entirely to the pits of hell. With a scene calling back to Rosemary's Baby, Lynch shows what appears to be Laura's father or some other guy named Bob (it flips between the two) mounting Laura as she sleeps, clawing with long finger nails against her body, and thrusting as she slowly wakes up, leading her to wonder if it was all a dream or not. This scene is certainly similar to Rosemary's Baby when Mia Farrow's character is raped by Satan in a dream-like sequence. In many films, such as Angel Heart or The Devil's Advocate, Satan is depicted as having long, gnarly looking nails and the character of Bob has these exact same nails."", ""The further she descends into madness and sin, Laura loses sight of any of the light of God in the film. In an early shot, Lynch shows a painting on her wall that has an angel serving food to children. Later, this angel is gone. In a scene where she is being attacked along with a friend also caught in this life, the friend is able to escape after a guardian angel arrives to untie her hands. Laura, however, is left to deal with every bit of the terror that her sinful ways has brought upon her. While perhaps not the most important theme, it is clear that there is some evil forces  bubbling under the surface here with these nefarious characters clear depictions of absolute evil in our world, capable of destroying the purity, innocence, and mental health of those who give into their temptations purely by being in their presence."", ""In line with this concept of purity, Lynch places with ideas regarding incest and the protective nature of fathers throughout. Creating horror out of images of Laura's father Leland (Ray Wise) seeing her getting awaiting his arrival to the bedroom after he had asked Teresa to bring her friends to their next encounter, the film dances with going all the way as Leland/Bob/Satan mounts her in the bedroom and has sex with her. This incestuous relationship is naturally jarring to watch unfold and one that neither wants, with both sharing repulsed glances at one another once they know the devious lifestyle the other leads that has led to some unwelcomed shoulder rubbing as a result. On one hand, the film manages to create horror and tension out of this weird relationship between the two that often spirals into absolute insanity, while also calling into question just who Leland is and why he is being used to get closer to Laura in this way."", ""Much of the horror shared between Leland and Laura is derived from the natural desire of a father to protect his daughter from growing up and meeting seedy characters. Seeing her as a sexual being is not just jarring, but Leland seeing her somebody being prepped for a man as sexually depraved as himself really does him in completely. He knows that Laura is just like the girls he sees, none of whom he actually respects. Thus, it is no surprise to see him freak out on her to wash her hands when he sees her after their unfortunate near-encounter in the bedroom. Yet, it is clear that this is not just some simple case of a father trying to protect his daughter from sex. By rubbing shoulders with these evil characters in his own journey through the film's story, Leland knows the dangers they pose to him, let alone his previously innocent and proper daughter Laura."" ]";5

Thus, in cinema, if he says something works in a film, who am I to argue? Taking Close Encounters of the Third Kind, sprinkling in Sidney Lumet's Fail-Safe, blending it with Bay's later film Armageddon, tossing in Robert Zemeckis’ Contact, and dumping it underwater like the end of A.I. Artificial Intelligence, James Cameron's The Abyss is both heavily influenced by other films and, naturally, its style is similarly influential. Though it may be a bit too cliche, sentimental, and wholly predictable, but in its sickly sweetness is Cameron's typical directorial brilliance. With pitch perfect action sequences and rock solid production design, The Abyss is able to overcome its sentimentality and cliches."", ""This mess of sentiment and narrative cliches is largely found in the relationship between Bud (Ed Harris) and Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio). With Lindsey the brain child behind the oil rig that is tasked with finding the lost USS Montana and Bud the man who operates the rig, the stage is set for this married couple to rekindle their love for one another. At the brink of divorce, always fighting, and butting heads, Bud and Lindsey's relationship is tested when the oil rig must face off with their Navy pals who are intent on blowing up the nuclear warheads on the USS Montana and with the alien aquatic species they encounter underwater. Cameron sprinkles obvious symbols and sentiment throughout this film with to their relationship, but it mostly all comes together to mean: love conquers all wounds.

When Lindsey is about to drown, Bud's love for her and unwillingness to give up on her breathing again is what saves her. When Bud is about to drown after doing a deep dive, it is his love for her that keeps him going and keeps him sane. It is cliche and similar to any number of films with the \""they really do love each other\"" trope. Sprinkled with the awe of meeting aliens and the reuniting of a once fractured couple and this is a sickly sweet concoction that one would expect from Steven Spielberg, but stands as Cameron's first foray into lazy emotional heartstring pulling (see: Titanic)."", ""This couple strife is at the center of many films and, yet, it is just one of Cameron's indulgences in cliches. Though Cameron is a master of action direction, his weak point has always been the story of his films, having to rely upon cliches and simple characterizations as a jumping off point for brilliant special effects and thrilling moment after thrilling moment. The Abyss is no exception, but does begin to run a bit clunky due to these indulgences in cliches. These cliches include the God-like aliens who are there merely to save humanity unless it demands destruction and the military characters that are overly enthused to blow stuff up even when it is readily apparent that their conclusion is way off the reservation. Cameron doubles down with that aforementioned relationship, however, in turning it into a \""love conquers all\"" type of film where love is given dominion over plausibility. Though a film about alien encounters, it can still be plausible until the end when love saves both Bud and Lindsey even when both would have died long before they met one another again. This implausibility and the cliches in their background relationship really undermines the potential emotion of the film with Cameron taking a shortcut to try and conjure up pathos. Unfortunately, with the implausible introduction of love conquering all and the sickly sweet setup, it winds up being nothing more than eye-roll inducing, predictable, and quite hollow."", ""That said, while the film has some serious narrative flaws, it is impossible to come away from a James Cameron film unimpressed. The man is a master of action and visuals. For the former, the film opens with the USS Montana going down under mysterious circumstances. Slowing building up the tension with radars going down and the lights going out, Cameron sets the scene for the film's science fiction conclusion, but nonetheless laces it with tension from the very beginning. Is it the Russians? Could they do this? Expertly pacing the moment with strong militaristic writing in the scene, Cameron manages to make the film's first few moments some of the most tense in the whole film while perfectly setting up the rest of the feature and, most importantly, not revealing too many of the film's underlying secrets."" ]";5

A film about quiz shows and how fixed they truly are, this one really manages to create incredible tension throughout as you watch everything unfold. There were numerous scenes that had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what unfolded, which I most certainly did not expect. An interesting film about networks, how they operate, and how they create/market celebrities to the public, Quiz Show is a film that often gets lost in the shuffle of the 1990s, but that is too bad.

Throughout, the repeating days never becomes old and tired, much the opposite in fact as every time he relived the same day it felt new and interesting. Plus, every scene never really ceased to be funny, as Bill Murray was undeniably at his very best in this film, both as a comedian and as an actor. In addition, the moral and events of this one are almost always very touching when they are not funny. Watching Phil Collins transform as a human being by living the same day is a great thing to watch and is also a credit to the great script for this one. The script manages to tell a story that has been told many times before in a very fresh and unique way, while almost tricking us into thinking it is brand new. That is not bad thing either, as it really makes this film all the more enjoyable and always leaves you wondering what is ahead next. Overall, this one is a very unique approach to a similar topic that never really feels tired thanks to its great acting, comedic elements, and script."" ]";5

While there is some violence, the emphasis is certainly not on it, rather it is on the characters here. Featuring great performances from Ray Winstone and Ben Kingsley, this one is quite subtle, but does think it is smarter than it really is at times. In director Jonathan Glazer's latest film, Under the Skin, I had the same complaint I do here in that he tries to make it seem deeper than it really is. His debut feature is far more enjoyable for me, but still features that same problem. Plus, some scenes were a little overdone and could have just been done normally. Glazer tries to outdo himself at times and it winds up hurting the overall product. In spite of that, Winstone and Kingsley were amazing and their chemistry is what made this film. As a whole, Sexy Beast is a good gangster flick that does try too hard at times, but when it stays focused, it is quite compelling."" ]";5
1493;lost-highway;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Lost Highway is as divisive as any other David Lynch film amongst critics and audience members alike. A confusing and convoluted film, Lost Highway's true interpretation is as hard to pin down as any other Lynch film, though it is perhaps a bit more accessible than, say, Mulholland Dr. In essence, Lost Highway is a film about the underbelly of society. Porn, sex, murder, and temptations abound in David Lynch's mesmerizing tale of a man who has opened his home to Satan and cannot get him out of his place. Told in the only way Lynch knows how - confusingly - Lost Highway can be off-putting, but for those willing to get swept up in its whirlwind, it is more than satisfying."", ""Satan has entered the home of the Madisons. This much is clear. If the suggestions in the beginning of the film that Renee Madison (Patricia Arquette) was different and not like herself, the conversation between Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) and the mystery man (Robert Blake) cement it. Telling Fred that this mystery man is in his home and also showing that he is the source of the videotapes they have received hinting at Fred murdering Renee, it becomes clear that Satan has a hold on this family. How did he get into the home of Madisons? Via Renee. Just as Eve is the reason sin entered the world after she bit the apple from the tree of knowledge, Renee is a sex worker and porn star. By engaging in these sins and keeping the company of Mr. Eddy/Dick Laurent (Robert Loggia), who has clearly sold his soul for money and fame, Renee allowed Satan into the home of her and her husband. Once this happens, Satan lets himself into the home and toys with the Madison's and messes with the mind of Fred. Sending him to jail and then dumping him briefly into the body of Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), Satan has his way with the Madison's, but ultimately gets his reward: their souls. Helping Fred kill Dick Laurent and welcoming Renee's nude body into his previously burning cabin, the Madison's souls are no longer their own. The transaction is, of course, orchestrated by Renee who says that the man who lives in the cabin will help her and her lover disappear."", ""Sin engulfs the entirety of this film with the porn tape between Renee and various people playing throughout much of the final half hour of the film. People are murdered or driven off the road by men like Mr. Eddy or they engage in a variety of other sins throughout the film. This indulgence and embrace of the underbelly of society wreaks havoc on the family unit and destroys it thoroughly. In many ways, Lost Highway crafts an ode to films such as Rosemary's Baby or a companion piece to fellow 1997 release The Devil's Advocate. All show the temptation of sin and the potential rewards of selling your soul, but they always come in this world. Once it is over, the fire rages all around (as it does in the Madison's fireplace and in the cabin) and nothing but the gnashing of teeth remains. This film and the others show the aftermath of this and the pain, strife, and threat posed to our lives if we allow Satan in via our own sinful tendencies."", ""A thoroughly hypnotic and freak experience, Lost Highway features a lot of similar traits to Lynch's works, namely wooden acting and weird people. Pullman and Arquette are terrific, however, and portray these sort of alien and confused people unaware of what hell their actions have awakened. The film is often stolen by Robert Blake, however, as the mystery man whose always looming presence is terrifying and thoroughly unsettling from beginning to end. Robert Loggia is also great in a truly intense and angry performance, instilling great fear and presence whenever he appears on the screen."", ""Lost Highway is a divisive film, but is an equally horrifying one that really feels Lynchian from beginning to end. A parable on the dangers of giving into temptation and making deals with the devil for success on Earth, the film is hypnotic, mesmerizing, and perverse. Yet, it is also brilliant and a truly surreal experience as with all of his works. Nobody makes unique films like David Lynch and every single one of his films continues to defy expectations and pre-conceived notions about the film."" ]";5

However, the second half really knocks it out of the park and leaves you with tears in your eyes for practically the entire final 20 minutes. Now, the ending is a little sentimental, but the film gets points for not going as sentimental as I thought it could have, so thank God for that. Haley Joel Osment is a revelation in the lead role and absolutely kills it. This film rests on his shoulders and the fact that he, at age 13, handles that burden this well and performs the way he did is stunningly impressive. The direction from Stephen Spielberg is also strong, though I would have loved to see Stanley Kubrick's take on this film, as I do think Kubrick would have done better with the materials he was given, not to say Spielberg did poorly. While the effects are great and the cinematography gorgeous, the real strength of this one is the pathos and pure child-like magic that really touches your heart. Without it, this one would be entirely lackluster. The ending goes on for a bit too long, but is actually filled with a lot more questions than initially meets the eye. At the end of the day, A.I. is an interesting film that is a success due to the emotions it provokes and how it utilizes its fantasy elements."" ]";5

1496;mash;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""MASH is a hard film to really enjoy on a first watch or, really, any watch. I knew what to expect. It was a satirical war film from Robert Altman. It will be character driven with little-to-no plot and it was mock the perception held of soldiers, the medical teams, and a little bit of religion along the way. But, MASH is incredibly abrasive. Its characters are deeply unlikable with how juvenile and sexist they are. They mock the women mercilessly and expose their body just to see them naked and to determine their natural hair color. These are vicious, dangerous men and it is nearly impossible to wring enjoyment out of this dark black comedy film. But, fortunately, there is meat on this film's bones with some typical Altman trademarks to sink your teeth into. I can only imagine how much I would have hated this if this was my first Altman though."", ""Juxtaposing the brutality of war with the juvenile hijinx of the main cast, the film focuses on Hawkeye Piece (Donald Sutherland), Trapper McIntyre (Elliott Gould), and Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt), three surgeons with the 4077th MASH in South Korea. Tremendous surgeons, they are also desperately horny and sexist throughout the film. But, the focus is the juxtaposition here. They are wise cracking idiots who perform brutal and bloody surgeries all day, but make jokes even during an operation. They travel to Japan to operate on a Congressman's son, make asses of themselves, complete the surgery with ease, operate on a baby, and then rush off to play golf. They are imbeciles and complete jerks, but they are brilliant men. Altman does a great job to portray this contrast, but it is truly a comment on war itself. No battle is shown here, but Altman expertly uses this pairing to show the brutality of war and the need to joke around to lose sight of the horror of the injuries they witness. They are able to make light of their situation to great effect and distract themselves completely throughout the film. The surgeons may have a horrible job, but these boys never let up and keep plugging along with crude jokes and horsing around the base. Staunchly anti-hero during this period of his filmography, MASH shows just how much contempt Altman has for people perceived as unquestionable heroes. Soldiers are just another one with frontiersmen and cowboys being his next targets in McCabe & Mrs. Miller and Buffalo Bill and the Indians. Here, he shows the surgeons in the army as being unrepenting jerks. While the banter between the trio is hilarious at times, they are sexist pigs who harass a nurse and reduce women to nothing but their looks and breasts. The men sit around all day and play pranks on others and finish the film by ripping off another MASH unit headed by a General. These guys are complete jerks, through and through. While they meet a better ending - getting to go home - than many other heroes in Altman films, the whole point is to show what asses they guys are. Thus, calling the film itself sexist is to miss the point of MASH. These men are sexist and likely racist, yes. But, Altman wishes to pull the covers back off of soldiers and make people realize that these guys are not all good. Some are great heroes, sure. These surgeons do great work and save many lives. But, men like Major Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) and the trio of protagonists are not deserving of praise beyond their work. They are asses to those they work with and treat nobody else with respect beyond themselves. Honestly, this is simply more of Altman's classic cynicism, but dressed in satire and a taken down of the cult of heroism surrounding soldiers."", ""As with McCabe & Mrs. Miller, the film also includes some religious critique. Though less overt than in that film, MASH features Walter Burns, a very religious man. While praying, he is mocked by Hawkeye and Duke. In no time at all, Walter shows himself to be a complete jerk by blaming a young boy for killing a patient when there was nothing to be done for the patient. He then follows this up by having sex with Margaret Houlihan (Sally Kellerman) with the duo justifying that it is \""God's will\"" they meet, even if Walter is married. In many ways, this is very similar to McCabe & Mrs. Miller in that Altman highlights the hypocrisy of many Christians. Saying one thing and doing another is prevalent in society, but man deride it in religion since it usually comes with a pompous attitude. Walter Burns is no exception as he believes himself to be a great man, at least better than the non-religious surgeons. However, it becomes clear that he is just as bad as they are, but at least they care to admit it and embrace the fact that they are **** Instead, he hides behind the veil of religion and pretends to be a good man. By comparison, Altman treats the Chaplin with great respect. He is shown to be a trusted and kind man who helps to save a suicidal patient. By the end, we see him praying of Hawkeye's car with no snide remarks from Hawkeye."" ]";5

In addition, though there are incredible faults in the script, the elements it does well certainly outshine the negatives.

Kat, the brains of the group and headed for Yale with astronomy, certainly missteps the most in love with Tim Travers (William R. Moses). Daisy, meanwhile, is the wild, crazy, directionless one of the group that, as the film reveals may be lost, but is no far off than Kat or anyone else. In her dealings with Charlie (Adam Storke), certainly shows her flair for the dramatic and rash impulses, but certainly learns from her experiences. Jojo, in her relationship with Bill (Vincent D'Onofrio), also demonstrates significant growth from a girl afraid to grow up to a full-grown woman ready for the future. As a whole, the women in this film are all incredibly written and, while they can be a bit stereotypical at times, the film never looks down upon them. Their actions are clear and explained. At the end of the day, they act entirely like real people with real problems. Rather than typecasting any of them, the film shows us why they take the actions that they do."", """", ""Additionally, the film really does a great job eliciting laughs.

While the writing does offer explanations and motivations, as it should, the characters still often run aground thanks to a storm surge of cliches. Those who will not enjoy the cliches of the genre would better off passing on Mystic Pizza. Moral boundaries, class issues, and the marriage question, permeate the film and the film offers no new insight on any of them. It offers no criticisms, rather it simply portrays its characters in these situations. In many ways, this is quite noble. However, as a film, it does feel a bit stale in that regard. Fortunately, a film that relies upon as many cliches as Mystic Pizza must handle them well to still be good and the film accomplishes this."", """", ""Overall, Mystic Pizza is a terrifically acted film that is fun to watch, funny, and a feel good experience.

Thoroughly Scorsese, the film is brilliantly captured from the cinematography to the staging with ambitious camera movements, transitions, and techniques utilized throughout. Matching the beautiful camera work, the film's plot is elegant and its dialogue is structured and stiff, perfect for the society portrayed. Set in the 1870s, the film is about a man named Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis). Awaiting marriage to May Welland (Winona Ryder), he becomes infatuated with the Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), who recently returned to New York society after time in Europe with her now-estranged husband, the Count. Now caught between what he should do and what he wants to do, Newland must make a decision that will have ramifications for centuries. Elegant, engaging, and gorgeous, The Age of Innocence may be too stiff for some, but for those willing to go along with it, it is a brilliant take down of New York society."", ""With an elegant, romantic, and truly rapturous score accenting the film, The Age of Innocence was always destined to be gorgeous. The score by Elmer Bernstein is tremendous and often takes center stage in this film with so many different highlights. Paired up with the tremendous score is the brilliant production design. Capturing the prim nature of the society, the buildings from the exterior and in the interior are dressed to the nines. Scenes of snow falling in the city only further highlight the beauty of the film's production design and the emotional coldness of its characters and the society in which they live. While the buildings are gorgeously crafted, they are hardly lively and instead represent the same structured and stiff nature of the society itself. The costume design, also beautiful, similarly communicates this rigidity. With corsets and detailed dresses that make statements on their own, this society is one that constantly demands its participants be \""on\"". If a person is unable or unwilling to perform for society's eyes, they will not be accepted into the society. The terrific costume design highlights this with every woman dressed up for a ball throughout and the men all wearing suits that exceed their \""Sunday best\"". Yet, the film is defined in small touches. For example, a windy day where all the men walk the streets and hold their bowler hats as they do so, for fear of it flying off due to the wind. The film is bolstered by small, detailed moments such as this and it it something that is found in the score, the production design, and the costume design."", ""In terms of the film's camera work, it is wholly unique. Naturally, there are eye candy shots in the cinematography of old New York, the homes of the people, and a gorgeous aerial shot that is quintessential Scorsese during the opening ball sequence. Shots set against the shoreline of Countess Olenska staring at the ocean with everything draped in an orange hue also stands as a true series of highlights, whether it be with the sun setting behind the lighthouse, a boat, or Countess Olenska. Yet, again, the film has some small touches that make its camera work truly stand out. Early in the film, it is marked by a sort of symmetry to the shots. The staging of people, candles, or paintings, highlight this symmetry that is not necessarily continued throughout, but is definitely worth mentioning and eye catching. What makes this camera work unique is Scorsese's usage of lighting and the frame. For example, a sequence with Countess Olenska and Newland at the theatre, already in the throws of subtle courting, Scorsese uses a truly odd technique. For lack of a better term, it is a sort of racking iris. It is a spotlight placed on the two as they converse, highlighting how they are in a world of their own. The sound cuts out except for their conversation, in spite of being in a loud theater. They have eyes only for one another and the spotlight emphasizes this with the two staring longingly at one another. As the scene progresses, an angelic white light begins to appear behind Countess Olenska, further making her enticing and hinting at Newland's impending obsession with her and possessing her love and affection. This technique later returns towards the end of the film when Newland reads a letter to May from Countess Olenska in which she outlines her intentions to leave for Europe and return to her husband. With this iris spotlight exclusively on Newland's eyes as he reads the letter, you can feel the hurt, the pain, and the sense of loss as he must now re-focus his love on May or forever chase Countess Olenska's love, which would only bring shame and scandal upon his and her family. Prior to this scene though, Scorsese has the curtains close on Newland and May.

It just feels like a diversion more than anything else, instead of a truly engaging Woody Allen film. This may be because it is so short at just an hour and twenty minutes. It does not get a chance to really sink too deeply into its characters and is quite skin deep in its characterizations. Though that portion is well done, I do wish it was longer and allowed me to follow these characters longer to truly figure out more than one-dimension of them.

In terms of a film, this can be a bit annoying as you feel as though you never really receive the film picture or scope of the proceedings. Additionally, the film can be quite slow.

From serving Lord Darlington (James Fox), a naive man who got tricked by the Nazis into joining their cause, to serving former American congressman Jack Lewis (Christopher Reeve), Mr. Stevens has been around for a lot, but he has experienced very little. In the name of serving, he has sacrificed himself, his happiness, and his life to fulfill his duties as a man-servant with honor, dignity, and respect. By the time he begins to regret some of these choices and miss the things he looked past, it is far too late to actually go back and experience them. Brimming with rigidity and staunchly set in its period design and mannerisms, The Remains of the Day is a film about a man who was never afforded time to actually be himself."", ""Set in the British class system of the 1930s, Mr. Stevens is a man who puts dignity above all else. His father may be dying and he may be quickly gaining feelings for housekeeper Ms. Sally Kenton (Emma Thompson), but neither the loss nor the love are allowed to be felt. For one, his father would have wanted him to focus on his work and dignity. Second, it is improper for a butler to be married to a fellow servant. As such, neither event gets explored and instead, they get compartmentalized and dumped into the abyss Mr. Stevens has created within his soul. He is the human embodiment of Spongebob in the episode where he only knows \""fine dining and breathing.\"" However, the latter is entirely optional should he be requested otherwise. For Mr. Stevens, being a butler is his life. No matter how many dignitaries or politicians arrive at Darlington Hall, Mr. Stevens is oblivious to the goings on of the manor in regard to conversation. When it comes to running the place, he runs a tight ship and expects the very best of the fellow servants and holds them to the same standard he holds himself. Unfortunately, in shutting his eyes and ears to what goes on around the manor, he loses sight of events. While Lord Darlington quickly falling into the grasp of the Nazis, Mr. Stevens remains oblivious. He is just there to serve his well-mannered and gracious lord who is not to be questioned or debated with. Rather, he must only appear when requested and do as instructed. As time and life passes him by, Mr. Stevens remains committed to servitude, but with regrets. As the world around changes into one that is less structured and less focused upon gentlemanly behavior, he realizes that his efforts in remaining dignified may have been misguided. Above all, watching Ms. Kenton get married and divorced leaves him wondering what could have been had he actually indulged in his love for her, which was certainly requited. He was a man so committed to his career and a false sense of duty that he was unaware of the humanity of the home. He knew where everything went, where every room was, and what everybody's duty was in the home. However, when tasked with explaining the \""birds and the bees\"" to Mr. Cardinal (Hugh Grant), he was rendered speechless. Through working so much, he had forgotten what it mean to truly live his life. When there begin to be cracks in his own rough exterior, he tries to suppress them and throw himself into his work. Through years of service, he has learned how to not feel and just do. This, however, has left him frightfully unfulfilled and constantly forced to endure the solemn recognition that his dedication left him working through life and never taking time to smell the roses and enjoy life. Now that his time is becoming increasingly limited and any reunion with Ms. Kenton out of the question, things will only become lonelier for this man who sacrificed himself to what he believed to be a noble pursuit."", ""In many films that depict butlers, their actions and work are background noise to the important conversations going on. However, here, the work is front-and-center. In exploring the life and times of a butler surrounded by important events, director James Ivory is not just able to explore the subtle changing of the times in Britain before and after the second World War, but also able to explore the life of a butler itself. Featuring complete self-sacrifice and dedication, the life is not an easy one, but it is one approached with pride by men such as Mr. Stevens who find it to be an honor that he is able to sacrifice his life in such a way. This is his calling. His passion. He takes it seriously and expects everybody else to do so as well. Ivory's film honors the men and women who dedicate themselves to servitude and receive very little in return for their honor, dignity, and manners. However, in honoring them, it equally mourns their dedication and expresses a desire for these people to be able to live"" ]";5
1508;hannah-and-her-sisters;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The films of Woody Allen manage to brilliantly blend comedy and drama, while examining life and all of the mysteries it holds. Hannah and Her Sisters is one of - if not the - best examples of this in Allen's work. Focusing on a series of characters undergoing crises in their lives, relationships, and careers, Hannah and Her Sisters is both funny and profound in ways that only a film by Woody Allen can aspire to be."", ""As always, the best part of any Woody Allen film is the writing and the characters. Hannah and Her Sisters is no exception. Witty and smart dialogue complements terrifically crafted characters. Hannah (Mia Farrow) craves affection internally, but is off-putting due to her appearance as the \""best\"" sister and being far more complete as a person than those around her. This can cause great tension for her and both the writing and Farrow's performance capture this dichotomy terrifically. She is dependent on her husband, Elliott (Michael Caine), but has no idea how to show this devotion. Similarly, Elliott is terrifically written as a man who lusts after Hannah's sister, Lee (Barbara Hershey). As opposed to Hannah's ex-husband Mickey (Woody Allen), his internal turmoil is much more internal and subtle, yet still ever present. Unsure of who he wants to be and his own life, Elliott's struggles lead him to stray, even if - deep down - he knows it will not satisfy him. However, one of my favorite characters here is Mickey. A hypochondriac who has an actual brush with death that leaves him lost, searching for meaning in life, and exploring religion, it is through Mickey that Allen really explores the meaning of the film. Hannah and Her Sisters is ultimately a film about life and finding purpose. Mickey, at one point, suggests the only point to life is love and that certainly seems to be the case here.  The characters have no other purpose and are left entirely unfulfilled until they are introduced to the one they are meant to be with, even if it does not click immediately. The only consistent thread throughout the whole film is the search for love. Every character does it and, once they find it, transform into an entirely new person."", ""This is really what makes the writing so strong. For a wide cast of characters, Hannah and Her Sisters slack with none of them and develops each sister, Elliott, and Mickey, with great dimension and craft that makes them wholly resemble a real human being. Each character has very human struggles and the film is unafraid to bring them to the forefront, allowing the film to be incredibly accessible and relatable to anybody searching for their purpose in life."", ""Hannah and Her Sisters continues to impress when considering the acting. As always, Allen's neurotic approach to his own character is charming, hilarious, and smart. He is greatly complemented here by a sturdy performance from Mia Farrow and an uncharacteristically neurotic performance from Michael Caine. Though less funny than Allen, Caine's character is certainly just as erratic and lost, yet Caine's approach is vastly different though still terrific. As Hannah's sisters, Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest are also terrific, as both women embark on their own personal journeys of self-discovery through the film. Lost entirely, Hershey greatly captures the way in which Lee is unsatisfied and going back to school in order to find her purpose. A typical path for many lost adults, Lee's story is certainly a highly relatable one and Hershey does a great job playing the role in a very grounded fashion. Finally, Wiest plays the recovering drug addict, acting, and now writing sister very well. By the end, she truly makes the greatest transformation from a paranoid, spastic sister to a stoic and well collected one who beams confidence, rather than insecurity."", ""Hannah and Her Sisters certainly lived up to the hype with terrific characters, writing, and acting. Smart, witty, and insightful, the film does a tremendous job examining midlife crises and the search for who we are and what role we are meant to play in life."" ]";5

The special effects are killer (lul) and the excitement they help to build is truly why Jurassic Park has gone down as a classic. Now, a lot of that is also likely thanks to 90s nostalgia and kids overhyping the movies they saw when they were 10, but all the same, Jurassic Park's special effects are a sight to behold. The terror and thrills are also ever present and really add an extra level of excitement to this one as you watch these huge beasts attack these people with childlike wonder. However, once you get snapped out of that childlike wonder, there are some issues, namely the acting. Laura Dern sucks here. The kids are not stellar. Then Richard Attenborough (RIP) is nothing more than alright. Luckily, Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill, and Wayne Knight, are all fine, which is a plus. However, the acting of Dern is the true cause of much of my distress, as she was just straight up bad. There are also some cheesy scenes that really detract from the overall product. However, as a whole, Jurassic Park is very exciting and the special effects are just too impressive to look away even when the acting sucks."" ]";5

Set on the docks of New Jersey, the film shows the level of control possessed by mob boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). A terrifying presence, his shadow looms over inch of the waterfront, with him and his henchmen deciding who can actually work that day and who must go home. Corrupt and deeply involved in the criminal underworld, Friendly and his men seek to silence any possible \""cheese eaters\"" by any means necessary. Part of the peripheral of their crew is former boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando). Working as a longshoremen, he is the young brother of Friendly's right hand man, Charley the Gent (Rod Steiger). This gives him ample opportunity at the docks, but also puts him in the crosshairs of the criminal case and, as such, finds himself getting squeezed by the cops. Starting a romance with pure girl Edie (Eva Marie Saint), Terry must decide whether he wants to remain loyal to Johnny or to himself."", ""Opening with one of the best first acts I have seen, in which Terry visits his friend Joey Doyle (Ben Wagner), On the Waterfront's opening sets the tone. Giving Joey a pigeon that he believes belongs to him, Terry is merely there to setup Joey. Professing later on that he thought that Johnny Friendly's men were just going to rough him up a bit and not kill him, this opening scene not only shows the vicious nature of the Friendly gang, but also sets up the conflict that will consume Terry's being. Feeling great remorse for getting his friend killed and then being unable to face Edie, Joey's sister, with the truth even when the two begin going together, Terry realizes his only way out is to rat. However, in doing so, everybody he loves will be put in danger. But, to not do so would be to become complicit in the continued exploitation of the longshoremen by the ruthless mobsters that run the union."", ""Through this tale of corruption and intimidation, On the Waterfront paints a frightening picture of blue collar America and how easily it can transform into lawlessness if a ruthless criminal gets their hands on it. Easily crushing all opposing forces due to the desperation in the area, Johnny Friendly is the gatekeeper  between being broke and being able to work for a living. In essence, he is the man capable of ruining you or helping you. His brutal killings and beatings of those that step out of line only further establishes him as the head honcho in the area and not a man to be toyed with. Leaning on a local priest, Father Barry (Karl Maiden), for help and strength, Terry must overcome his own issues and fears to be able to stand up to this powerful man and tell the truth to the courts. Through this, the film becomes not just scary portrayal of crime and its influence on the poor, but also on the strength and courage it takes to stand up in the face of absolute adversity."", ""One of the more apparent themes at play in On the Waterfront is ambition and life goals. Having become hardened over time due to his exposure to the crime underworld, Terry has largely given up on his dreams. Once a promising boxer, he had to throw away his career to allow the mob to win its bet on the fight. Now, he opts to avoid having dreams to avoid future pain. As a result, he never reached his potential in life and is left wallowing as a longshoreman that is considered a bum by everyone around him, even Edie's father and often times, Edie herself. Having passed on every opportunity before him and throwing away his life in the name of supporting his brother and Johnny, Terry must finally work towards his own goals. No longer can he put everybody else ahead of himself. Being selfish is a quality he desperately needs to learn, as without it, he is being trampled on by all the men on the docks. He is a man who feels he has failed in life and by ratting on the crime bosses, he can finally live up to his own expectations for himself and not be such a disappointment. He can be more than a bum and not have to worry about becoming a beggar on the streets. He can live in the comfort of the knowledge that he did what was right and lifted the control of the docks away from criminals."", ""Featuring a career-best performance from Marlon Brando, On the Waterfront may be a bit too melodramatic at times with a poor-to-mediocre romance given too much screentime, but on the back of excellent direction from Kazan and Brando's bravado, it lives up to its classic billing. Brando's authenticity as an actor and his committed performance as Terry really bring the film to life and make it feel akin to something out of the Italian neo-realism due to its intense focus on the harsh reality of life. Now, a lot of this is due to Kazan to be sure, but Brando brings truth to this representation of life. He is Terry Malloy. Terry Malloy is him."" ]";5

Anything short and Mr. Grant will not even consider taking that role. As it stands, Bridget Jones's Diary (is that gramatically correct?) finds him in typical charismatic, playboy footing as Daniel Cleaver, one of the love interests fighting for the heart of Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger). The other, far more settled contender is none other than Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). A British woman's fantasy come true, the film is a truly entertaining comedy with a killer script, good characters, and quality adherence to rom-com formula."", """", ""With terrific casting, the film is already blessed from the get go as Zellweger is terrific and perfect for the role of the not quite beautiful, yet certainly far from ugly Bridget who is single at age 32. Somehow, she manages to find her way in the middle of a love triangle. If only I could find myself in this position at age 32 with two beautiful British actresses (maybe a little old for me at the moment, but I will certainly accept Keira Knightley squaring off with Carey Mulligan...just saying). As the more stable and clearly better candidate, Firth is his typically classy and stoic self, which is perfect for the character of Darcy. Given the misinformation we are given about Darcy at the beginning, it makes the reveal of his true nature make all the more sense. We all knew that there was no way Darcy could be a jerk because Firth played him. In this way, the film kind of shows its hand with some pretty solid typecasting, though the acting is good I could care less. As the charismatic Daniel Cleaver, Hugh Grant is terrifically devilish. Somehow, you find yourself wanting Bridget to get back with him just because it is Hugh Grant. No shame."", """", ""The film may adhere very closely to romantic comedy formula, yet it is a terrific example of a well-written script in this area. I always feel the need to defend the scripts of these romantic comedies since people often write them off without seeing the film. About Time, Crazy, Stupid, Love, The Devil Wears Prada, Easy A, and 10 Things I Hate About You, being certain examples of this. Yes, they are aimed at women. Yes, they are cheesy. However, they also perfectly execute the rom-com formula. With likable characters, likable partners, and strong character development, Bridget Jones may be incredibly cliche and overly romantic for manly men, but it has what many cliche films miss. The only problem with cliche is when the film using it misses the essence of the cliche. Just having two people kiss does not make it effective. Having two people fall in love does not make it effective. Rather, having there be passion, emotion, chemistry, relatability, and heart makes it effective. Many films that use cliches often miss this. Yet, thanks to strong writing, Bridget's anguish and loneliness becomes your own. Thus, when she finds her man, you swoon. It makes you care and want to smile right along with her."", """", ""Comedically, Bridget Jones does find some faults due to an over-reliance on cringe comedy. It causes me physical pain and is not my style. Putting the protagonist in such awkward positions it makes me have to look away from the screen is not funny. Though the film can be cute and charming with its comedy for the most part, there are a few too many scenes deeply reliant on making me cringe, which is an absolute shame."", """", ""An undeniable piece of pop cinema infused with late 90s/early 00s pop music that makes you want to dance in your seat, Bridget Jones's Diary is a truly enjoyable romantic comedy with likable characters and a romance you care about.

With terrific performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, American Gangster feels more like a 1970s-early 1990s gangster flick, rather than one released in 2007. With strong writing, good characterization, and a steady pace, the length of American Gangster never becomes a problem and the film never feels like it has filler. While it does pale in comparison to better gangster films like The Godfather or Goodfellas, it is a great look at New York City crime and Frank Lucas in particular, while serving as yet another showcase for Denzel Washington. A truly sprawling and epic feeling biopic, American Gangster successfully covers its subject, while expertly handling interweaving subplots and having a surprising lack of confusion when it comes to following both its plot and large cast of characters.

The laughs are not many, but there are certainly enough to call this one a comedy and the drama elements work very well here. Wes Anderson's direction is brilliant as usual and the cinematography fantastic. The three leads, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson, all turn in good performances and do a great job making themselves feel \""real\"" and the relationships authentic.

For starters, Al Pacino is great once again in his role as Michael Corleone. The changing landscape of the families is also well presented as we see many youngsters trying to come into the business, while many of the key players from before are now on their way out. In addition, the homages to the first two films and footage from the first two were brilliantly used and really added a nice touch here. For the most part, it was nice to see some things brought to a closure from the first two and how the family has progressed and regressed over all of these years. However, the negatives here really are what hold the film back. Firstly, the plot can be overly complicated at times, likely due to poor storytelling. At times, things would happen and you are trying to figure out what just happened and why. However, the major issue is the acting. Andy Garcia is fine for the most part, but at times, he fails to step up to the plate. I still feel like he had the charisma and energy for the role, I just wish his performance did not slump at times. Sofia Coppola was horrendous. I always thought people were overstating how bad she is, but you simply cannot overstate it. I think my dog could have been a better Mary than her."", """", ""Overall, this final entry into the Godfather trilogy is much like the raisin cookie to the first two's chocolate chip.

Instead, the women are jerks, but all the same. The film takes a typical approach to the subject with typical narration and time jumping to tell a more complete story. While George Jung is certainly an interesting man, the film simply does not do much to separate him from other figures and their respective films. That said, Johnny Depp and Ray Liotta do a very good, though their make-up team dropped the ball since they do not age over the course of twenty years aside from their hair.

The film is also a surprising source of thrills and some horror movie elements (though not a horror movie by any means) in large part thanks to the great score, good sound, and creepy atmosphere fostered by the Coens.

Rather, it managed to have my attention from beginning to end trying to follow everything that was going on. For starters, the plot is a bit confusing and convoluted at times and that would be a bad thing if they did not resolve my questions at the end. Throughout, the tension is always present and keeps you on the edge of your seat as more and more questions get answered and the puzzle pieces start coming together. At the end of the day, it is amazing just how far some will go to keep their dirty secrets from being aired and, really, that is what this one is about. The film summary on many sites is somewhat accurate, but really fails to capture what this one is truly about. The writing here is also very sharp and the cinematography is very stylish as well. George Clooney is also great here, as well as Tom Wilkinson and Tilda Swinton in smaller roles. Then again, the acting as a whole was very good. Finally, the monologue delivered by Wilkinson at the beginning (and later finished as the story truly begins) is also phenomenally written and delivered.

In a career full of great performances, it is tough to say that one is better than the others, but this one has to be up there. De Niro is honestly phenomenal and creates chills like nobody else can. Nick Nolte is also quite good here and does a great job making the audience unsure on how to read his complicated character. We know he is not a good guy, but we undeniably side with him since he certainly made the right choice. That said, Scorsese is in full control here and shows his skill at creating atmospheric tension and pure suspense, more so than some horror directors out there.

Did they get played? Ultimately, the correct answer may be a combination of things, but that fact makes this one a ton of fun to watch unfold. The writing here is quite strong, as is the direction. However, the best part of this film is Sharon Stone. In a role that uses her good looks to seduce both Michael Douglas' character and the audience, she is phenomenal here as she makes you believe her every word, even though you know she cannot be trusted. A porno with plot, Basic Instinct could have toned down its sex scenes without much of value being lost, but ignoring those, I really did enjoy this one a lot.

1521;total-recall;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The original is it a dream or not film, Total Recall is yet another science fiction classic from director Paul Verhoeven. He knows how to make objectively fun films that are essentially the cinematic equivalent of wrestling. Loud, dumb, and obviously scripted, but since both he and the audience are in on the gag, it is fun to watch. Pairing this with a ripped and confused Arnold Schwarzenegger and a story based upon a short story from Philip K. Dick, you just know this is about to be an excellent watch. In many ways, it feels akin to Dune due to the obsession with control here on a distant planet, though in Total Recall it is air. Starring Schwarzenegger as Douglas Quaid, the film shows him as a relatively normal man married to Lori (Sharon Stone). However, as he goes to a company called Rekall, that allows people to pay to have memories implanted in their mind, things go haywire for him. Choosing to go to Mars and to become a secret agent, the route the film takes is ultimately up to the viewer. One side can claim it was all a part of the dream, but one that he began to believe. The other can claim that it is all true. He came to before the memory was implanted and after they had discovered he had his mind wiped due to the secrets he held from his time as a Mars Intelligence Officer that could threaten Vilos Cohaagen's (Ronny Cox) control over the air on Mars."", ""In many ways, Verhoeven reminds me of a more ambitious and unhinged version of David Cronenberg. Both are obsessed with constant depictions of sex and violence in their films, yet take different approaches to them. Verhoeven is more tongue-in-cheek, whereas Cronenberg is more serious. Yet, both share a similarity: inventiveness. From the gadgets in their films to the world they create, their films are always incredibly imaginative and demand further exploration. This is certainly part of the appeal of watching their films as around every corner is something you never imagined being in a film. This is an incredibly fun experience as a viewer as the weaponry, sets, and the world as a whole are so intricately designed that it makes it all seem real. Every detail is accounted for, even when the plot may become a little too odd to bear. This is a world that is always available to be explored and is a fun journey to be on throughout."", ""Yet, what this film thrives on is paranoia. With Douglas constantly told his true identity is Carl Hauser and that this is all a dream, he has no idea how to respond and neither does the audience. It is hard to pin down what is and is not real as things seem to be too finely put together by Hauser to not be a setup and things go too closely to what he signed up for with Rekall. Yet, other moments show that it is definitely not a dream with people turning against him or remembering him. Of course, that may be the very point. Total Recall walks a fine line between both options, but what is clear is the tension and paranoia this balance creates. It is excellent for entertainment purposes and really keeps you on edge as you try to figure out, scene-by-scene, what is really happening or what could be an implant."", ""An area of complaint for this film would definitely be the acting, which always a lot to be desired. Though, it may just be a trait of Paul Verhoeven films at this point. Inherently satirical in tone and style, the acting seems surreal with it simultaneously being unconvincing and overacted. This is a mainstay quality in many Verhoeven films with the actors seemingly in on the satirical tone of the film by playing their characters less than seriously. It is always jarring, especially with Arnold's constant one-liners littered throughout this film also contributing to this general feeling, but somehow thoroughly appealing to watch unfold at all times."", ""In watching Paul Verhoeven's filmography one thing, aside from the violence and sex, becomes immediately clear. Many of his female protagonists are quite similar and what I would like to categorize as the \""Verhoeven Woman\"". If Howard Hawks can have his own female cliche, I think Verhoeven definitely deserves some credit for his own cliche. With Lori (Sharon Stone) - Douglas' apparent wife - and Melina (Rachel Ticotin) - Douglas' apparent lover -  Total Recall introduces two Verhoeven women. Both women are overtly sexual and entirely objectified throughout. They ooze sex appeal and the film plays up this sexuality with both wearing greatly revealing clothing and constantly trying to engage Douglas in sex. Yet, this sexuality is always juxtaposed by Verhoeven with complete empowerment. Though these women may be agents forced to sleep with their marks or hookers who both suffer from the male gaze, they are completely capable and able to function on their own. Lori is a ball busting agent in Douglas' world and is more than capable of holding her own. She even skillfully takes down Douglas as any man with her training would be able to do."" ]";5

It is simply a film about a chance encounter between two people with a major connection between them. What ensues is one of the best romantic films ever made with phenomenal writing (seriously, some of the dialogue here is perfection), great direction from Richard Linklater, and terrific acting from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Both leads turn in very natural performances that fit in perfectly with the feel this one gives. Honestly, it feels like a documentary about two people who actually fell in love in Vienna.

He really steals the show, even though Jeff Bridges is awesome as well in this one. Ultimately, their acting is what makes this film what it is, but the film itself is a weird, oddly effecting, and charming, little flick that really covers all of its bases. On top of this, the script is pretty strong and it has a really nice combination of comedy and drama that go together very well in this one and the transititions between the serious and the comedic moments are almost seemless. In addition, the characters are very well developed in such a short time frame and it really lets you know their motivations well and why they act the way that they do.

1524;scanners;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Scanners is a David Cronenberg film, through and through. Though not strictly defined as a body horror film, Scanners still offers some elements of Cronenberg's beloved subgenre with blood vein effects and exploding heads. Nothing makes this man happier than to make his audience's skin crawl as we watch a body do something that it should not be doing. Scanners is no exception to this constant rule. Telling the story of a select group of people capable of scanning, a sort of telepathy, and the attempts to control them by a company called ConSec, leading to a underground group of Scanners, the film finds Cronenberg operating in similar thematic territory. Though he later refined this theme in films such as Videodrome or eXistenZ, his distrust of business and the horrid picture he paints of the underground is never not intensely scary. Yet, while the film has a lot going for it, the ending is far too much and almost shows Cronenberg lacking a way to actually end the film."", ""Now, of course, many of the scenes in Scanners are phenomenal. The classic head explosion being one of them, but the scene towards of the beginning when Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) is first brought and the film shows him tied to a hospital bed, is the best by far. Scanning allows the person to hear the thoughts of everybody around them and, if they focus it on something, gain the thoughts of the person they link to. In this hospital scene, Cameron knows nothing about his unique trait and simply hears the voice. Complementing the rising intensity of the voices with a creepy score in the background, Cronenberg creates a scene laced with claustrophobia and the harder Cameron fights to get out, the more the audience can feel their skin crawling. This scene stands as a real highlight of the film and paints the scanners as a sympathetic group who have a great skill, but also a great curse. Cronenberg also finds success in the characterization of everybody, particularly his villain, who is hard to identify. Both people within ConSec and the underground are evil and seek nothing but world domination. By having ConSec know that a drug made a company gives fetuses this horrible disease and with Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside), leader of the underground, killing scanners who do not join him, it makes it hard to know who to root for. On one hand, we have an evil business that dabbles in morally unethical and illegal practices. On the other, we have a ruthless man who will stop at nothing to topple that company. Does the end justify the means? Probably not. Cronenberg never asks you to root for either side in the conflict, however, as he shows both sides to be negative forces. Those who control and those who commit violent acts are not to be rooted for and though this is a topic he will come back to later on his works, it is one he somewhat toys with in Scanners. Always inventive, Scanners reminds me a lot of Carrie by Brian De Palma with the scanners capable of incredible actions using nothing but their minds. People are burned, buildings set on fire, and people are thrown like rag dolls. Seems a lot like Carrie, minus the gratuitous shower shots in favor of good old micro effects to create the tension and horror. That said, Cronenberg does a lot with the plot and constantly keeps things moving. Good pacing and a mostly inventive plot allow the audience to constantly be engaging with the film and trying to get a grasp on this weird world of Cronenberg. That said, it is hard to define the film. Given the horrific acting, it is hard to say whether it is intentional or not. Cronenberg may have wanted to have wooden acting to highlight how emotionless and alien the scanners are, but everybody acts that way. Yet, one of the worst elements here is the finale. While the build up is great and always engaging, the finale is far too much. The whole film is over-the-top, but the finale takes it another step and goes right over the ledge. Perhaps I was too tired or something, but it struck me as Cronenberg simply running out of ideas and going for some mental gymnastics of a conclusion. Unfortunately, its mystery and inconclusive nature - while intriguing - do not help make up for Cameron and Darryl's epic scan off that causes their faces to melt and eyes to blow up."", ""A thoroughly weird film, Scanners is the definition of a David Cronenberg film. With bad acting and a poor conclusion, however, classic Cronenberg goodness runs out of speed towards the end. Fortunately, the proceeding 80 minutes are terrific, filled with tension, and a great build up."" ]";5
1525;kramer-vs-kramer;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Released in 1979 when female nudity was still allowed in PG-rated films, Kramer vs. Kramer is still as powerful now as it was then, even if the film is now 38 years old. About a couple - Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) - who separate, divorce, and are now fighting a custody battle, the film is achingly real. Blessed with an authentic and heartbreaking script from Robert Benton, Kramer vs Kramer never ceases to both break your heart and be an absolutely riveting film. Praised for portraying the concerns of both Ted and Joanna evenly, Kramer vs Kramer may paint Joanna as a bad guy in the film, but her concerns are valid ones with regard to her marriage to Ted."", ""Ted, a workaholic, is a distant father. He provides financially, but misses the crucial part: emotion and low. His son Billy (Justin Henry) barely knows him. Joanna is done. She has been unhappy and forced to be a stay-at-home mom against her wishes, so she leaves. Ted is neglectful and old school with a set understanding of what a wife should be and do. This does not work for Joanna, so she leaves him and Billy to find herself and happiness. For the next 18 months, Ted and Billy fight and are forced to learn to live and love one another, while Ted is forced to parent. The end result is an unbreakable bond that Ted could never imagine having severed in the future. As such, he gets quite defensive when Joanna comes back with a job and wants to take her son back full-time. This is where Kramer vs Kramer fails to be fair, as it shows Ted and Billy for the most part. When Joanna gets Billy briefly for a visit, we only see how Ted handles giving him over. As such, we write off Joanna as a parent and start rooting for Ted to get the kid, even though this **** wants to take Billy away from him. That said, for his part, Hoffman has incredible chemistry with the young Justin Henry. Hoffman plays an incredibly sympathetic man with great gravitas and care for the nuance of parenthood. He refuses to demonize Joanna and instead begins to look inward and identify what made her run away. He knows he screwed up and feels great remorse for those errors."", ""On the flip side, Meryl Streep is impeccable. Her testimony is raw, powerful, and engrossing. Her delivery is always top-notch and it is hard to deny that this is a performance worthy of her first Oscar. She is limited in screen time compared to Hoffman, but she makes an impact every time she appears on the screen. As Joanna, she plays this forward-thinking mother who looks beyond the home for gratification and success. As such, a home life is at odds with what she truly wants. Though she loves Billy, having him live with her would be a mistake for the both of them, even if she is a good mother. Her realization of this is an incredibly powerful moment in the film and underscores Joanna's confusion and lack of focus in her life at the moment."", ""Impeccably written, as mentioned, the film's main fault is that it takes Ted's side. We understand Joanna, but never comprehend why she wants to take Billy away. Why must Ted be limited to every other weekend and she gets the kid? The film too readily cops out and blames archaic beliefs of the judge that mothers are more important when, in reality, it must explain why Joanna refuses joint custody and wants Billy full-time. The two could split him and the end result would be hard, but easy to understand. Yet, they go guns blazing at one another because Joanna wanted to. This is unfortunate and makes her hard to sympathize with, even if her reason for divorcing Ted makes sense."", ""A powerful film, Kramer vs. Kramer is a riveting and thoroughly engrossing family drama that has authenticity in every line. Hoffman and Streep turns in powerful performances as the warring couple, even if the writing seems to take Hoffman's side a bit too much. That said, it is an incredibly nuanced and timeless film that rides on the back of its impeccable characters, real life drama, and acting."" ]";5
1526;the-doors;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The Doors is hardly a biopic of Jim Morrison or The Doors. Instead, it is a gateway drug in the form a feature film. Through the life of Morrison, director Oliver Stone finds cinematic peyote and injects it into the veins of the audience and leaves us with an oddly spiritual experience. Hypnotic, indulgent, and excessive, Stone discards  the story of Jim Morrison and The Doors in order to tell a more compelling tale through the atmosphere of the film. In essence, he turns an otherwise cliche biopic into an experience that transcends its cliched trappings within the musician biopic subgenre. Adorning his film with the sexual escapades of Morrison, the making of songs, and a soundtrack complete with the greatest hits by the band, Stone's film is a transcendent biopic that feels eminently rich and entertaining."", ""This power and atmosphere of the film is defined very early on. Eschewing most of his childhood and just dropping him in college, the film briefly runs through the forming of the band in order to dump them in the desert. Having the band take peyote and trip together in order to get ideas for the film, it is here that Stone conjures the psychedelic feeling of the film of simulates an acid trip through his film. Shot throughout with an orange filtered haze, the film is hypnotic and continuously unexpected. It is also in this desert that Stone really finds his hero: Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer). Tossing aside most life details in favor of this aesthetic and atmosphere, Stone needed a man to carry it on their shoulders and Kilmer does exactly that. He disappears into the role and I had to constantly remind myself that this was Ice-Man from Top Gun. He is phenomenal to an unexpected degree and really embodies Morrison, but more importantly, embodies the feeling that Stone is trying to conjure. It is a match made in heaven between director and lead and the film benefits tremendously from their on-screen chemistry."", ""Yet, the clearest Stone comes to showing the audience that he could care less about the story is the San Francisco concert sequence. Opening with The Doors performing at an outdoor concert in the Bay Area, Stone keeps the music playing, but cuts through a very unique montage. Containing images of Jim participating in a witchcraft ritual to be united with some weird girl, people dancing nude around a fire at the festival, Jim catching Pam (Meg Ryan) cheating on him and taking heroin, Jim lighting his house on fire, and Native American spirits dancing with him on stage, the film is odd at this point. Yet, it is equally as gorgeous. Stone does not strike a balance between the aesthetic drug trips and Jim's reality. Instead, he goes full bore into the former. Those expecting a traditionally told biopic will come away disappointed because that was never Stone's intent. Instead, he wanted to drop his audience into the mind of Morrison and to see the world from his point of view. It is honestly the only way to sympathize with him and once we feel the drugs and negative influences in his life, it becomes obvious how this man died at 27."", ""It is this style that saves the film. While Stone makes the concert scenes powerful and epic, as they should be, the stylish storytelling and orange filtering cover up a largely run-of-the-mill tale. Stone takes no risks in the story itself, which becomes more noticeable after the hypnotic opening half hour. The indulgence in the sexual temptations experienced by Morrison is an unfortunate detour, but continues to show that his life was certainly done by the seat of his pants. Unfortunately, the rise and fall of his life is written in a pretty cliche manner, it is only once Stone gets his hands on the material that it truly soars and becomes an oddly beautiful biopic and a behemoth of one at that."", ""The Doors is an experience. Their music most certainly is, as the lyrics are hardly special. Rather, it is the feeling that it creates within you where the music finds its power. Oliver Stone knows this and seeks to create the same feeling from his film. He is certainly successful with the film transporting the viewer to an alternate dimension where Jim Morrison was possessed by Natives and that is hardly the weirdest thing the film convinces its audience of. It is indulgent, excessive, and off-the-wall. But, above all else, it is thoroughly engrossing, atmospheric, and completely epic. It story is cliche, but its storytelling transcends the stale and repetitive musician biopic subgenre."" ]";5

It is never uproariously funny, but the humor it goes for often times works pretty well. The acting is fine as a whole and the story is interesting. However, something just feels like it is missing. It is hard to put my finger on it, but I was left slightly underwhelmed. I was entertained and the movie was just fine, but there was a part of me that felt like there was something that was not there that should have been there. I guess my problem with the film is that it felt relatively safe. It was not extraordinary in any way and was content just being some movie rather than going for more. While fine, I doubt this one will be one I remember in great detail. Just feels run-of-the-mill."" ]";5

Though the film's villain can be a little much at times and thoroughly over-the-top, the film's mythical and whimsical foundation allows me to write this off. While the film does not present much in terms of uniqueness or challenge to viewers, Chocolat is a thoroughly pleasant experiences that is good, but not my favorite. That said, the acting really does elevate it as Binoche does quite well and Johnny Deep turns in a typical young Johnny Depp charismatic role.

The film is also notable for a great performance from Gary Farmer as a Native American who helps Depp. The gentle and sympathetic portrayal of Native Americans living near whites is great and really helps bolster this one. All at once, Dead Man manages to be your typical western, but also manages to be completely unique within that genre, which is a weird place to be and makes this one hard to judge. However, thanks to great dialogue that is used only when needed, great performances from Depp, Farmer, and Michael Wincott, as well terrific direction from Jarmusch, it is tough to look away from Dead Man."" ]";5

An incredibly well known film, there is not much new to be said about Cast Away other than to say that I really enjoyed it. It was brilliantly acted by Hanks and damn, the film made us care about a volleyball. Sure, it is a bit by-the-numbers in the way things happen and the film itself breaks little new ground, but that is just fine by me, as long as it is well done. In the case of Cast Away, that is certainly the case. It is very well directed by Robert Zemeckis and very well written. Other than Hanks, nothing about this film is excellent, but all of it is good all the same. The special effects here were also really well done and the crash sequence was brilliantly executed and packed with excitement. This one really puts you through every emotion possible, which ultimately, is what film is supposed to do.

However, as a whole, the film is very funny, endearing, and quite charming, as we watch Hoffman transform into a woman in order to try to rescue his acting career. Easily the funniest part of the film is watching serious scenes with serious implications unfold with the knowledge that Hoffman is actually a man and being the only ones aside from his roommate (Bill Murray) who knows this. In addition, him working on his interpersonal relationships from both sides really leads to some interesting conversations that also help to add to the comedy of the film. In terms of acting, really everyone did well and aside from Hoffman who obviously stood out, Bill Murray was great. He was his usual self from the 80's, which really made every scene he was in quite funny. Overall, Tootsie is a fun film to watch (there are some awkward moments that make you cringe, but those aside) and is a solid way to spend an afternoon."" ]";5

The direction from Steven Soderbergh is also very good and I also really liked his cinematography here. The different tints to each story really gave each their own unique feel, even if they all concerned the same topic; drug trafficking. Ultimately, Traffic is a brilliant look at the many different aspects and roles played in the world of drugs and how easily lines between good and bad can be blurred. On top of that, it reenforces that nobody involved can get away without being altered forever. Every story it goes through is interesting in their own way. Many call this a thriller, and while elements of this are indeed thrilling, it struck me more as a drama and I thought the dramatic elements outweighed the thrilling ones, but that is me. Regardless, Traffic is an incredibly ambitious film from director Steven Soderbergh that is ultimately a resounding success that leaves you wanting more, even though its run time is two and a half hours."" ]";5

Incredibly witty, subtle, and smart, State and Main is an interesting behind the scenes look at the making of a Hollywood film that manages to make you laugh, smile, and be thoroughly entertained throughout.

However, the proceeding hour and 45 minutes were terrific. Tense, engaging, and draped in paranoia, Jack Nicholson turns in a terrific performance as a detective who keeps working a case after retirement and is intent on finding a man who is kidnapping and viciously killing little girls. Some have called the film's subject disturbing, but the film is never graphic (or at least never more graphic than your average crime mystery). The rest of the cast is very able with Benicio del Toro standing out amongst a sea of talented supporting actors. The direction from Sean Penn is more than capable and though I disagree with his decisions towards the end, the rest of the film is great.

The movie I got was not the one I was expecting at all and I am completely ok with that, as the movie I got was way better than the one I expected. In addition, the acting from the whole cast was good. Nobody really stood out (in fairness, no one person had a large enough role to stand out), but since everyone was good, no complaints there.

1542;postcards-from-the-edge;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Adapted from Carrie Fisher's semi-autobiographical book of the same name, Postcards from the Edge finds director Mike Nichols in fine form. While not firing on all cylinders like his best works, the film's down-to-earth writing and acting allows the film to feel truly authentic in telling its somewhat true story. Though Fisher claims that the characters of Suzanne Vale (Meryl Streep) and Doris Mann (Shirley MacLaine) are not her and her mother, the similarities are plentiful and either deliberately included to make us feel they are Fisher and Reynolds or Fisher was being less than honest in saying they are not them. While perhaps every scenario did not happen, obviously, the rooting of the characters are in her own experiences and this certainly adds to that aforementioned authenticity, but also allows the film to really find the comedy in every situation with great success."", ""Yet, no matter how authentic Postcards from the Edge may be to Fisher's experience, Nichols never seems to capture the heart and soul of Suzanne's strife. Compared to his magnum opus, The Graduate, the film lacks the understanding and feeling. Perhaps because I am a graduate so that film really speaks to me, but it has an intimacy. It makes you feel the protagonist's problems and Nichols' nifty staging and tight camera work only further instills this feeling. It is a masterpiece of cinematography, music, framing, staging, and overall direction. Yet, unfortunately, Postcards from the Edge has none of this. It is a film that is shot quite plainly and with limited style by comparison. The closest Nichols comes to this pizzazz is in the staircase sequence between Streep and MacLaine. Putting MacLaine at the top of the stairs with Streep yelling up to her about how she ruined her life, Nichols brilliantly stages the sequence to show the power structure here. Suzanne, at the bottom, looks up to her mother, but resents her all the same. She has put her on a pedestal and Doris has certainly found it comfortable with how she looms and hovers over Suzanne's life from the top of the stairs. Looking down upon her as she tries to climb the stairs to reach her heights, Doris hopes she will stay below her, but also wants her to join her at the top of the mountain. It is this conflicting and misguided anger that really tears these two apart, but also what brings them together."", ""Thus, it is a shame to see scenes like that be matched with others that are largely straight-forward. It shows the struggle of overcoming addiction. It shows overdosing and the pains of alcoholism. However, it lacks the feeling. It never makes it intimate and ever-present. It is just something that Suzanne remembers constantly and  has to try to overcome. The film never makes it all feel real, no matter how authentically written and portrayed the film may be. Fisher's script captures the events, but Nichols' direction never captures the horror of dependency on pills and the struggle to loosen its grip on one's soul. Rather, it makes it all look like something that pops up every once in a while or is referenced by characters. It has all the beats, but lacks the connecting thread of emotion to make it all come together."", ""Fortunately, the film more than makes up for this with impeccable writing and comedic direction by Nichols. While he does not strike the right chord there, subtle jokes in the background of the movie sets or excellently witty dialogue written by Fisher give the film excellent punch and a constant sense of hilarity. Streep and MacLaine's performances are smart when comedic, but powerful when dramatic. The two are able to bridge the two together without cheapening either. This is not a dark film with some light moments or a light film with some dark moments due to their performances and the strength of the direction and writing. Rather, it is a film about life. Life can knock you down, but it can also make you laugh when you least expect it. Yet, there is a certain rhythmic beauty to its consistency. One month you are up. One you are down. Postcards from the Edge captures this ebb and flow beautifully and it is due to the harmony between the two extremes found by the directing, writing, and acting. All three balance this weight on its shoulders and allows the film to achieve that authenticity that it so badly needed."", ""While not the best film of Mike Nichols' career, Postcards from the Edge just serves as a great demonstration of Nichols' skill as a director. While he may not capture addiction terrifically, he captures life beautifully in the film and is able to bring Carrie Fisher's script to life in those moments. Smart, witty, and excellently acted, Postcards from the Edge is a film that will make you laugh and will make you cry. In the end, that is all that one can ask from a film and it delivers it consistently with emotions going from one extreme to the other within a single scene. What is more real than that?"" ]";5

While the role is one that largely exists to open the eyes of her male counterparts, Hepburn makes Sabrina her own and really injects life into the role. Nominated for Best Actress for the role, it is immediately apparent why and it has nothing to do with her natural charisma and charm.

When she cannot get this, she is entirely satisfied with running off to Paris and finding the romance she craves in the Parisian aesthetic that she so loves. That said, while the film's characters are a great credit to it, the film's comedy is really where it stands out. As a romantic comedy, the comedy is always crucial and the film's comedic wit and whip smart moments are really what makes this one so endearing and charming.

Instead, there is a status quo that will remain until action is taken."", ""For David and Linda, the best option is to just drop off of the grid and travel the country. By his own admission, this is a path that David once mocked people for in his youth, but it is one he is not greatly envious of being able to accomplish. Likely a by-product of life always being greener on other side, the idea is nonetheless rather admirable. Similar to the counter work culture experience in the 20th century via films such as Fight Club, American Beauty, and Office Space, Lost in America speaks about the hollow existences experienced by those in the workforce. Get up, get dressed, go to work, come home, pass out, and then do it all over again. This robotic lifestyle has turned us all into corporate drones, merely waiting for our next promotion or opportunity to prove ourselves at work when, in reality, investing in ourselves and in our lives is far more worth our while. Rather than kissing ass at work, why not let loose and live a little for our own mental health? Yet, Brooks' film is smart. Never idealizing the lifestyle of just living on the road, Lost in America shows the perils and sore points that could arise. Loose spending and celebrating one's newly found liberation a little too much could lead to great stress and anguish in the blink of an eye. In essence, Lost in America argues for a balance. Taking time away from work to live one's life is a vital part of living that everybody should attempt. Becoming a mindless zombie who only knows how to go to work is not what the American dream is truly about, no matter what we have been taught growing up. Rather, the American dream is about the freedom to live one's life as they choose. We can never entirely drop off of the grid, as a source of income is a necessary evil in the world. Yet, that necessary evil is no reason to remain stationary and never utilize the freedom of movement. As a result, the American population have misused the American dream through misinterpretation. Believing it to be solely about how anybody can make themselves into something through hard work - implying dedication work - the American dream is truly about how anybody can live their life as they wish and by their own design. Striking a balance between what we need to do - work - and what we want to do - in the case of the film, travel and move to new locations - is where the key to truly utilizing the American dream lies. Becoming a slave to work or an unemployed drifter are perfect examples of taking a lifestyle to the extreme with that way of life feeling too restrictive and dull after a while. Blending the two together allows one to truly find a measure of happiness in a world so dictated by success in the workplace. If, as a society, we came together to realize that work-life balance - and thus, truly realizing the American dream of building a family (life) and a career (work) no matter who you are"" ]";5
1546;no-country-for-old-men;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Great film as expected and one that really reminded me of my favorite Coen Brothers film, Fargo, at certain times, though this one is far, far darker. However, much like Fargo, this one is anchored by strong performances (especially Javier Bardem who was absolutely postively amazing), as well as brilliant cinematography by Roger Deakins, and great directing by the Coen Brothers. I am not a huge huge Coen Brothers fan, but their skill is undeniable and it is on full display here. In particular, the thrills and then the lack of a \""satisfying\"" ending were perfect. While many were bothered by the ending, I absolutely loved it. While it may not be what you are looking for, it feels all so appropriate. However, easily my favorite sequence is the opening sequence with the great monologue by Tommy Lee Jones, which really sets up the rest of the film perfectly. In addition, Anton's first victim that we see really sets the tone for how crazy and vicious he really is. Finally, the setting is gorgeous. I am a sucker for western settings in film and this one is no exception. It really lends itself to beautiful shot after beautiful shot and Deakins and the Coens really use it to its fullest."", """", ""On the negative side, the film is a tad slow admittedly. While it is thrilling and exciting and never really boring, it certainly drags at times (though everything has a purpose in the film). Not a major knock, but a knock all the same.

Though it did not resonate too much with me, I do think that is a shame because there is a lot of good here."", """", ""Wonder Boys' biggest sin has to be stereotypical approach to its topics. The general narrative of a lost man finding his path with funny hijinx along the way and the with the help of a few crazy characters is screenwriting 101. Unfortunately, the film really fails to add anything new to the trope and thus, much of what it has to say falls on deaf ears simply because it feels extremely \""been there, done that\""."", """", ""This said, this plot is so cliche because it is so effective. Most films that follow this path, if well-executed, can never be outright bad simply because they elicit so much positivity and just make you feel good. In essence, Wonder Boys is a crowd pleaser. For many, this will rank among their favorites simply because of the strong writing and the way in which the film has an indelible ability to bring a smile to your face. Hell, they kill a dog and it is hysterical! That is unheard of in film. The dog dying typically brings a dark cloud over the film, but this one makes it funny. A true accomplishment of the film's pitch black comedy."", """", ""The film is also blessed with good performances across the board. Frances McDormand and Katie Holmes turn in good performances, even if their characters are pretty one-dimensional. Robert Downey Jr. plays a good gay druggy, as expected. The only two characters with some real meat to their bones are Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) and James Leer (Tobey Maguire). Douglas plays the grisled, unhappy, and aimless college professor very well and, though it is certainly not a role you expect to find him in, he demonstrates his considerable range. He does often play unhappy and adulterous characters, yes, but certainly not ones who have merely lost their path. No, his mid-life crisis characters often come with a dose of crazy attached to them. Here, he is the rock and the settled down adult, except he is simply feeling worthless. He finds his worth in the troubled James Leer. For me, Tobey Maguire is often hit-and-miss, eve in the same role. As the unhinged, brilliant, and deeply mentally ill Leer, however, Maguire is a wonder. With only slight emotion shown throughout, he is able to perfectly capture the inner feelings of Leer and bring them to light."", """", ""Good acting aside, the film's writing is a little on-the-nose at times, namely as Douglas spoon feeds the audience what the point of the movie actually was. If you did not figure out that Tripp and Leer needed one another and learned from each other, then director Curtis Hanson ensured he literally told you. I am never a fan of movies that simply do not think highly of their audience and Wonder Boys seems to fit the fill."", """", ""However, Wonder Boys is simply so pleasant, I cannot complain too much. Often pretty funny, moving, and quite engaging, the film is a true crowd pleaser that possesses a career-best performance from Tobey Maguire. Though the writing is typical, thin, and the dialogue is on-the-nose, Wonder Boys is a largely enjoyable and interesting look at a man finding his path with the help of someone who barely realizes there is a path."" ]";5
1550;the-rock;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The Rock is one of Michael Bay's best works, though it does pale in comparison to his best film, Armageddon. Released two years prior to this peak, The Rock features a lot of positive elements. From spectacular action sequences, solid acting, and being gloriously over-the-top, the film has a bad ending that too fully embraces lunacy to feel appropriate. Featuring a cast led by Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, and Ed Harris, The Rock is hardly restrained and is in danger of careening off the edge throughout, but it remains a wildly entertaining and bombastic experience that highlights some of the best elements that Bay has to offer the world of cinema."", ""With masterfully shot action scenes, Bay graces the film with a style all his own and, though he indulges a bit too much in explosions, the film is still a great action movie. Throughout, Bay laces the film terrific tension as Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) and John Mason (Sean Connery) race through Alcatraz to try and save San Francisco from assured death at the hands of General Hummel (Ed Harris). In the scenes in Alcatraz, The Rock really soars with great tension, fun set pieces, and incredibly well shot action scenes. Here, Cage and Connery feed off of one another with great chemistry as the duo ham it up in this insane action movie. As the villain, Harris is oddly sympathetic. Hardly a killer in the vein of many movie villains, Harris merely wants recognition for his fallen comrades, not to kill thousands of people. A true leader, Harris' Hummel is a man who instills fear, but is well-developed enough to make him an admirable foe. Compared to modern action movies, creating a villain that is incredibly worthwhile and not just after world dominance sets The Rock apart and makes it a thoroughly enjoyable experience."", ""Yet, aside from this, The Rock loses weight compared to a film such as Armageddon. Both show that Bay knows action, as all of his work honestly does. Armageddon, however, showed that he knew how to create pathos. Throughout, you root for the good guys for a variety of reasons and there are incredible stakes. The Rock does not boast this quality. It tries to create it with Dr. Goodspeed and his pregnant girlfriend or Mason and his adult daughter, but both fail. Neither woman is given enough screentime, Goodspeed's girlfriend is a moron and never in harm's way, and Mason's daughter comes and goes as quickly as a Michael Bay explosion. As such, The Rock has thrills and tension, but lacks an effective emotional edge to really given the film depth and punch. As a result, it is a largely hollow experience with very few lasting moments from the film."", ""More egregiously, the ending is nearly comical. Yes, the rest of the film is over-the-top and insane, but with the bombing of Alcatraz and the scene in the Church at the end, The Rock goes a little too crazy with the hilarity. In particular, the final line of the film and underlying element throughout regarding what Mason knew about top secret information hardly adds to the film and instead makes it an exercise in stupidity."", ""Fortunately though, The Rock remains action-packed with killer action sequences such as the one in the showers or the moment before with John Mason rolling through the flame throwers. Over-the-top and exaggerate, Bay shoots these moments with incredible style that leaves you wanting more and fully engaged in the sheer entertainment of the film. Throughout, Bay gets incredibly creative with a good backstory about the weapon. He also does add some depth story-wise with an appeal to recognize fallen soldiers and to step back from the ledge in regards to biochemical warfare. A worthy message, this film serves as a wake-up call as to what is possible if we lose our ethical mindsets."", ""Overall, The Rock is an entertaining film that stands amongst Michael Bay's best work. With campy performances, a great villain, and an interesting story with great action and tension, The Rock simply falls apart by lacking pathos and a suitable ending."" ]";5

Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, are all stupendous. All of their characters are endearing in their own way and really steal the spotlight individually at times. The directing from Cameron Crowe is great and the story is told wonderfully. It really does not glamorize rock and roll of the time, but it certainly makes you fall in love with these flawed human beings as we interact with them through the eyes of a young 15 year old writer. We truly fall in love with these people as he does and struggle through the same struggles he does as a writer on this trip that changes his life forever. Ultimately, Almost Famous is a resounding success and a film that provides laughs, drama, and just enough of romance, to keep you interested. A truly great film."" ]";5

John Malkovich is fantastic as the bad guy and really gives you the chills. He has the right amount of hurt and insanity for the character he played and did it phenomenally. Clint Eastwood, though a little old, is very good as well. The story is intense and Wolfgang Petersen does a great job creating a ton of tension. The pace is brisk and I liked the focus on dialogue, rather than a focus on action shootouts like in many thrillers. I think the love interest element was unnecessary and just tossed in there, as it added really nothing to the film, honestly. As a whole, In the Line of Fire is a good, intense thriller that works from every angle and though formulaic, it is a great example of using a formula very successfully."" ]";5
1553;thelma-louise;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Thelma & Louise is a film that is not hard to grasp. Criticized as anti-male upon its release in 1991, it is clear that the feminist message of the film was a bit much for some. However, the film is not as much feminist as it is a film that pulls back the curtain on the patriarchy in cartoonish fashion. With every male character essentially a caricature of a certain aspect of the patriarchy, Thelma & Louise is, on the surface, just a female buddy film. A road movie, it is essentially a dual female take on Bonnie & Clyde with Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) committing through crimes throughout the southwest United States and trying to outrun the cops. In the film, director Ridley Scott explores various elements of the way in patriarchal thought has corrupted society and highlights the attempts of men to control, possess, protect, abuse, rape, and harass women due to the belief that women are subordinate to men."", ""To showcase each element, Scott creates plot devices to fulfill each attack on women that men commit. The most apparent is control. With Thelma & Louise on the run, the men around them try to control them, but not as much as the police. As they are criminals, the police issue a manhunt for them to try and find them, with little worry as to whether or not they are dead or alive. Of course, they are criminals, thus they are interested in finding them. However, the greatest crime they commit is stepping out of the acceptable behavior for women. The cops immediately assume the worst of the women, running straight to their husbands and boyfriends to try and reign them in and bring them back to normalcy. It does not hurt either that all of the cops are white men. As white men are seen as the most privileged members of society, they are often the aggressors in crimes against women. Thelma & Louise highlights this element with all of the cops being white men who take these crimes as a personal affront and send an absurd amount of cops to try and capture these two women. As predicted by Louise, the men are unconcerned with the circumstances of her shooting Harlan (Timothy Carhart). Though he was raping Thelma and was acting aggressive towards the women, it is hardly a concern because Thelma was likely \""asking for it\"", thus she could not be raped. The biggest concern is that a fellow white male was executed for simply trying to claim his prize. As such, it is up to all of the white men in the police force to bring these nasty women to task for their crime. However, it is in this section that the film shows how it is not anti-male. With Thelma and Louise having locked up one of their oppressors in a trunk of a cop car, a black male smoking marijuana finds the car and, instead of helping the cop, blows smoke into the car. This scene establishes that while Thelma & Louise may be about women fighting back against white men, it is equally a film about highlighting the oppression that all groups considered \""lesser\"" must endure in modern day America."", ""The control of the cops transitions well into the protectiveness men feel for women. The lead detective on the case is Detective Hal Slocumb (Harvey Keitel). While all of the other men are gung ho about getting and killing these women, Hal preaches amnesty. He does not want these women harmed and is not afraid to express this opinion. At the end, when they are driving off into the Grand Canyon, he chases after that, hoping to save them from their own demise. An off-shoot of controlling women, men have an inherent nature to protect women. In 2017, this has led to \""white knights\"" or prototypical \""nice guys\"" who see themselves as a sort of savior of womenkind, prepared to show them generosity and kindness that they have not seen before. In the film, Hal very much fills this role. As a cop, he should be trying his best to capture these women, but instead opts to take on a protective role and tries to shield them from the dangers of the men he works with. Unfortunately, his tactic is hardly wholesome as he still wants to arrest them, so at his core, he still wishes to exert control on these wily women."", ""The reason these women are in this position, however, is because of the attempted rape of Thelma by Harlan. An essential part of any film about the patriarchy and its dangers, rape and rape culture must be discussed. Killed by Louise for his crime, Louise knows that rape culture dictates that Thelma asked for it, considering she has been dancing with Harlan. Thus, the controlling and protective cops are not an option for these two. While Harlan very literally wished to force himself upon Thelma, the symbolic implications of rape are far greater and shows how women are raped by men on a daily basis. Whether it be actual rape, visual rape, or the violent seizure of their independence and rights. Here, Scott opts for the very visceral scene of rape, but Harlan is hardly the only man to rape a woman in this film. By attempting to control them or limit them"" ]";5

The various elements of Hollywood that are parodied are too numerous to list out, but each is given its due and is really mocked thoroughly. Though it can be over-the-top at times, it is a fantastic time throughout that really exceeded my expectations completely. I expected it to be pretty dumb all around, but instead, I got a crazy good time that kept me laughing from beginning to end. The writing is good, the mise en scene as a whole is very good, and I loved the make-up and characterization in particular. Overall, Tropic Thunder lived up to the hype and more."" ]";5

This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride, and The American President are comical riots. I often watch comedies and, in the spirit of hating fun, do not find them very funny. There are very few comedies that actually hit the right notes for me and leave me gasping for air. When Harry Met Sally joins those other Reiner films (aside from The Princess Bride, which was pretty good, but not nearly as funny) in making me laugh consistently from beginning to end. With charismatic turns from Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, the film is oozing with chemistry, joy, and commentary on relationships. Even better, it casts aside Hollywood romance cliches in favor of a realistic approach to love and inter-sex non-sexual relationships."", ""Pairing together Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan), the film actually takes a while to put them together. Yet, while the romance begins to take root, the pair's comedic chemistry is natural and easy to watch. With a manic, depressive, and neurotic style of comedy, Billy Crystal drops top-notch lines like they were nothing. Comedy just rolls off his tongue like butter on a pan. Alongside him is the far more stoic and proper Ryan who plays Crystal's comedic foil. Yet, make no mistake, she can be funny as well and really goes toe-to-toe with Crystal from the very beginning. Yet, what really helps to make the film funnier is the writing from Nora Ephron. With quotable lines coming from every direction, the comedic writing here is stellar with a tremendous understanding of the skills of the leads and playing to those strengths. The material Crystal and Ryan are given is within the realm of their comedic talent and charisma, allowing for free flowing joy and comedy."", ""The film's other major strength in the writing is its relationship. Resisting the temptation to throw its originally mismatched leads together, it builds up authentically. Putting them together as friends who avoid sex to ruin the friendship and then finally give in to temptation, but resist is brilliant and real. Though a classic Hollywood romantic comedy film, it does not deliver a cliche and over dramatic pay-off. Instead, it feels real. Harry and Sally could be real people who have finally pulled their heads out of their asses and saw the sky for the first time. They resist the love they feel to not lose a friend and, when they finally give in, it is clear they are a match for one another. Yet, through fear and trepidation towards losing this great friend, they still remain skeptical. For many, this is a fact of life and to see it so brilliantly portrayed on screen shows the real triumph of this film."", ""One of the main reasons why I loved When Harry Met Sally though is simply the pure, unbridled joy of watching this film. It is an easy watch, but yet a great exploration of romance and friendship. It pairs two incredibly likable leads together, puts together realistically, and does not rush anything between them. Sprinkling in real life stories of love and marriage only adds to the magic of the film. Rob Reiner knows comedy and it is really shown in this film, even though he rarely gets the credit he deserves as being a top-notch director when working with great material (mainly because his output since the late 1990s has been garbage). Here, he crafts an eminently likable film that blends romantic comedy cliches (two lovers who hate each other first being a common trope) and then adds layers of realism to the equation that largely subvert the cliches to the point that Billy Crystal running through New York to find Meg Ryan feels authentic and real. Rather than absurd, it is a bombastic, romantic, and magical gesture that encapsulates the power of love and the crazy things it can make people do. Classics always have a lot to live up to, but When Harry Met Sally exceeds all expectations with impeccable comedy, comedic frequency, writing, and romance."" ]";5

With good supporting turns from Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow, and Jon Lovitz, through this opening part, Small Time Crooks is a phenomenally funny comedy. After this, it begins to drag until its second act finally begins to hit its stride at which point it returns to being hysterical. However, due to this dragging portion immediately after the film skips ahead a year, Small Time Crooks is held back from being a better film. As it stands, however, it is a fun blend of crime and comedy while also being a good statement about staying true to yourself, marriage, and class structure. Overall, Woody Allen has better films, but Small Time Crooks' failures certainly do not derail the film and it remains a charming, funny, and entertaining film."" ]";5
1557;the-conversation;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Right when it seemed as though Francis Ford Coppola had reached the pinnacle of the cinema world in 1972 with The Godfather, he decided to mess around and release two Best Picture nominees in 1974. Though The Conversation would lose to The Godfather Part II – honestly, I wonder if Coppola wanted one to win over the other or not – it has become revered as yet another classic from Coppola in the 1970s. Add in Apocalypse Now and it is clear why he is still revered a legend of the screen, even after releasing light hits and decided misses in the years since. A masterful mystery thriller, The Conversation was a bit of a diversion from The Godfather as a shorter film, but it is styled in very much the same fashion. Slow, character-driven, and building up slowly to its crescendo, Coppola’s The Conversation may not be quite on the level of The Godfather films, but with great sound, direction, acting, and a truly engrossing plot, The Conversation certainly holds its own among the towering triumphs achieved by Francis Ford Coppola in the 1970s."", ""Starring Gene Hackman as Harry Caul, The Conversation is a mystery thriller about a man who records a mysterious conversation. That man, Harry Caul, had been hired by a mysterious third-party (Robert Duvall), known only as “the director”, to record this call. With the help of his assistant Stan (John Cazale) and others, the conversation is recorded at great pain with the involved parties seemingly avoiding such an operation by walking in a loud open area and going in circles. As time goes on – and after some close encounters with the director’s assistant (Harrison Ford) – Harry begins to believe that this recording is something much more. Will these people be killed? Are they targets of some kind? Or are they plotting something? Trying to unmask the secrets of the scenario, armed only with his recording of this one-off conversation, Harry is driven to very brink of paranoia. In many ways, The Conversation often plays as a direct influence on later works such as Brian De Palma’s Blow Out or the 2006 German film The Lives of Others. With the protagonist being a largely innocent party who happens to record something of a very sordid nature, the film finds tension in initially framing the situation as one where Harry must protect those he recorded, out of fear that they will be harmed. However, clues along the way make it entirely possible he has it reversed. Or, is he just entirely paranoid and nobody is at risk? Smartly plotted, slow, and unwilling to explain everything, The Conversation is one of those films that seems to answer its questions and reveal the secrets behind its plot, but it only leads to further questions. It is a film that really sticks with you and refuses to let go due to its incredibly strong writing and the fantastic execution of its premise."", ""It is from this uncertainty that the film really plays up Harry’s paranoia. Slowly unraveling over the course of the film, it quickly becomes clear that Harry is not entirely mentally sound. Due to past regrets over having gotten people killed because of his recordings and his own paranoia about being recorded, Harry is a man ready to unravel at any point. With his new recording possibly leading somebody to die or be killed, his old regrets bubble back up to the surface and begin to wreak havoc on his mental health. Yet, where it makes the most profound impact is in his fear of being recorded. He knows the lengths that many will go to in order to record others and snoop on them. He also knows the damage a simple soundbite can create. Thus, he is desperate to avoid this with an intense alarm system in his home and absolute secrecy with his women. While a brilliant man in his field, it does not take a genius to realize that Harry is not all there. Brilliantly capturing this, Gene Hackman turns in a very nervy and on-edge performance where Harry is constantly appearing frazzled. On his face, there is a paranoid look of wonderment as to where “they” may be hiding to spy on him, even when he is alone. Nobody can be trusted in this world driven by paranoia with Hackman’s interpretation really nailing this feeling. Coppola’s use of music and camera movement also helps greatly in the film’s final scene. Showing Harry rip out his whole home after being confronted with an actual recording of himself, the scene is intense and frighteningly frantic. With a deeply unsettling backing track and a tight camera shot that spins around the room centered on Harry, the final moments of the film feel entirely claustrophobic. The ultimate culmination of all of his worrying regarding being followed or hurting others is confronting him and backing him into a mental corner that he may never escape. Intense and thrilling, this final scene is honestly quite horrifying and shows just how damaging paranoia, even when one has nothing to hide, can be to the human brain."" ]";5

First off, the acting is great from all the kids and adults, though I do not know if I am buying Kirsten Dunst as a 14 year old here. Just saying. Great acting and fit the beauty required for the role, but having been 14, I can confirm no 14 year old looked like that when I was 14. Anyways, the film is gently directed by Sofia Coppola and she handles the sensitive subject matter very well. The story is very interesting and very well told. I like the handling of the narration, as well. Narration can sometimes feel unnatural, but it felt like that was the only way to tell this story and it never really messed with the flow of the film. In fact, it really helped the flow of it. Ultimately, the film has a very distant and melancholy feel to it, which really helps drive home the story and really makes it hit you. However, that same distance can prevent you from getting into the film. You feel as if you are arm's length away from the film and prevented from getting any closer. In the context of the film, this can be effective, but in terms of pure enjoyment, this film would benefit from a feeling of intimacy that would really pull the viewer in. Regardless, The Virgin Suicides is a good film that tells this depressing story and makes it feel almost dreamlike and beautiful in a really twisted way."" ]";5

Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, and Michael Madsen, are all fantastic in this one. Ultimately, this one is a gangster film that does a really good job developing the characters and making them all very human. By the end, you can see why Depp's character is going through the things he is and the conflict he is facing. In addition, though you know Pacino and Madsen are bad men, you feel a ton of sympathy for them. That is a key to the success of many films and this one completely nails making us care and feel for the characters, no matter how bad of a person they may be. In addition, the development these characters go through in two hours is great and feels like a good representation of the true story behind this one. My only complaint here was the beginning, in which the development happened at the snap of a finger and seemed a little rapid and unlikely. I feel like they probably skipped over some information there, which is too bad. However, as a whole, this one is very good and a good depiction of what really happened minus some small inaccuracies.

Heck, he commands it even when he is not on screen. The film as a whole is also very interesting. It feels a bit rushed in the beginning, which can lead to confusion, but as it slows down and settles in, things improve. However, the film still requires that you know at least a little bit about the stock market and even then, there will be things that will be confusing for many. But, the story is well-written and well told thanks to solid direction from Oliver Stone. Aside from Douglas, the acting is also pretty solid, though there are some moments of very poor acting from some of the supporting members and Charlie Sheen just never really works too well for me here. He is alright, but gets outclassed by Douglas. Overall, this film is made by Douglas and has a pretty effective story surrounding him that never really fails to have you attention. In spite of its negatives, the overall product is pretty good and enjoyable."" ]";5

Exciting, fun, and wholly thrilling, Predator actually works quite well. The character development is, in a word, poor. However, the action more than makes up for it with the quite pacing and sheer watchability overcoming many of the film's technical faults. The look of the creature and the special effects are quite dated by now.

Telling the story of the convergence of two storm systems: a nor'easter and Hurricane Grace, The Perfect Storm is a harrowing real life disaster film. Focusing in on the Andrea Gail, a fishing vessel, and the problems she encounters as her crew battles valiantly against the storm with their loved ones awaiting them on land, it does not take a genius to figure out that things will not work out for them. With excellent special effects and thrilling sequence after thrilling sequence on the boat and in the air, The Perfect Storm is exactly what a disaster movie should be: entertaining. As it is based on a true story, the film tries to add weight to it and sort of works, but mostly just feels hamfisted and too manipulative, especially at the end."", ""That ending is really what drags this one down, which is a shame. Introducing us to Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney), Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), Murph (John C. Reilly), Bugsy (John Hawkes), Sully (William Fichtner), and Andre Pierre (Allen Payne), who are the six men aboard the Andrea Gail, The Perfect Storm really tries to develop its characters. It shows their loves and their lives before they set sail one last time to their grave at the sea, while constantly cutting away from the scene at sea to show how their loved ones are handling it all. In particular, there is a special emphasis on Bobby's girlfriend Christina (Diane Lane), who eagerly awaits his return with his mother. Yet, the film's cloying and manipulative punches at the end border on offensive and always absurd. As their ship goes down and the men realize their fate is a bleak one, two things occur. One, Murph remarks how hard his son will take his death. Two, Bobby tells Chris he loves her even without being able to say goodbye. In the aftermath of the sinking, Chris reveals that she had a dream with Bobby where he relayed the exact message he said to her while at sea. Considering that these are real people, to be playing this angle up is honestly very sad to see. The final words from Bobby being the most head-smackingly stupid moment of this film."", ""That said, man those waves are cool, eh? This is a disaster movie, so it is tough to not just look past the issues with the characters. The scene at the bar and the gathering of the crew wet my pallet just enough to make me care about these people, as well as the fact that it is real. At all points, I was rooting that they could get back to shore with their load of 60,000 pounds of fish. After the crew had gone through so much together and struggled mightily to find fish, this gold mine of fish felt hard earned. I wanted to see them be reunited with their families and be able to leave the business having made a very good score. However, there is no such moment. Where the characters may be paper thin, this is a film that wears its heart on its sleeve, which bleeds openly when these men continue to fight against the massive odds before them."", ""Yet, the star here is the special effects. Coupled with an excellent score from James Horner, The Perfect Storm has a great cinematic quality with excellent scope and ferocious thrills. No matter how many times it shows the boat hitting massive waves or showing the Air Force rescuing various people, the film is always laced with tension. Director Wolfgang Petersen shows that he still has it throughout this film as, in lesser hands, one can only imagine how awful this film would have turned out. As it stands, it is a film that leaves you riding the edge of your seat for the entire second half of the film and, as a result, really meets my requirements for a film of this type. It is a thrilling piece of cinema with great special effects that does an excellent job showing both the danger and the camaraderie of the moment with these six men putting their differences behind them to unite and confront mother nature. Though a battle they will not win, this does not mean the small victories and battles along the way are any less thrilling to watch unfold."", ""Celebrating the brave men that sacrifice their lives to save others or to provide for their families, The Perfect Storm is one of those disaster movies that do not really get made too often nowadays, which is a shame. Wolfgang Petersen delivers a film that tries develop some characters and manipulates our emotions too heavy-handedly, but it is also a film with a great cinematic feeling to it that allows it to rise above its inadequacies. Thrilling, old school style filmmaking that is blessed with modern effects, The Perfect Storm is not well rounded, but its thrills, spills, and real life chills allow it to remain a solid and thoroughly entertaining disaster film."" ]";5

This is not a film watched for the plot, for the acting, or for the dialogue (seriously, if Satan arrives and one of his first actions is typing on a computer through some woman to say, \""In fact, YOU WILL NOT BE SAVED\"", I will bust a gut laughing), but rather for John Carpenter's ability to entertain audiences. Truly scary, ominous, deeply unsettling, and a film that makes you leery to investigate what just creaked downstairs, Prince of Darkness is a film with one hell of an atmosphere. Blessed by Carpenter's fantastic score, an engaging premise, and truly terrific scares, Prince of Darkness is a film that will leave you reeling once it is finished."", ""As the second entry into John Carpenter's Apocalypse trilogy with The Thing and In the Mouth of Madness, it is seemingly fitting that Prince of Darkness concerns the return of Satan to the world. However, rather than a Biblical interpretation, Carpenter has a twist on the tale. Using matter and antimatter as the basis, the world in Prince of Darkness exists in the antimatter plane of existence, with Satan existing to bring darkness in the antimatter world rather than the lightness brought by God in the matter-side. Jesus came as an extraterrestrial to warn humanity of Satan's return, all while Satan was turned into a glowing green fluid by his father (who was sent to the dark side) and buried underneath an old church. Overseen by a secret group of priests, this green liquid starts to formulate with the death of the latest guardian revealing to a Priest (Donald Pleasance) that Satan is ready to return. Teaming up with physician Professor Howard Birack (Victor Wong) and students, the group must now fight back against this being by deciphering what it is, what it is capable of, and then having to wing it to fight back in the end. In other words, this film is absolutely insane."", ""Yet, it is this insanity that makes Prince of Darkness so appealing. Playing fast and loose with logic and timelines, the only bits that are important are that this pile of green liquid is super powerful, takes over people to do its bidding, and then will slowly possess the body of one of the people to fulfill its goal of bringing its father back through a mirror portal. This all sounds like something Carpenter dreamt up, yet it all somehow works. The corny acting, the cheesy plot, and the B-movie aesthetics, are what gives the film its charm and makes it such a blast to watch. While hardly a concrete reason to love a film, as one can easily enjoy a bad film, Prince of Darkness is one those films that has such an immersive and well-thought out world that any absurdity, silly turns, or insanity is forgiven. It creates a world that is so easily dove into and enjoyed that the audience goes along with this insanity and wants to jump right back in when the film ends. It is a cinematic experience like few others, creating a world so enticing, unique, and thrilling, that it feels like cinematic cocaine. One hit of Prince of Darkness and you are hooked, begging for the film to just give you a little bit more or to simply never end."", ""While the concept of this film is absurd on the surface, it is Carpenter who breathes life into this odd script and weird collection of events and characters. Delivering a slow build-up with the one-by-one elimination of the physicists, the realization of what is happening, and the slow return of Satan just in time for the finale. Carpenter's perfect pacing allows the film to unravel at just the right pace to keep the viewer on edge and jumpy. With the surrealist dreams as a great added touch on top of this, the ominous hints about what is to come only further serve the film's tension and fantastic atmosphere that leaves you hooked to see what is coming next."", ""As with all Carpenter films, one of the film's greatest assets is undoubtedly its score. With a great synthy, ominous, and greatly creepy score, in its back pocket, Prince of Darkness sets the tone early and often with Carpenter often relying on the score alone to add tension to seemingly innocuous events. Yet, it is not the type of score that becomes overbearing or a film that becomes too reliant on its score to scare. The events depicted do that well enough. However, the score amplifies these scares and the tension, creating a terrific atmosphere that keeps on edge and makes the scares that much more effective. The audio as a whole does the same with little bumps, creaks, and other noises giving the film a great edge and bite to it that keeps audiences guessing as to what that sound was or simply creeped out as to what we just heard coming from the other room or the other side of a wall. Sound is often Carpenter's strongest asset and Prince of Darkness exemplifies why that is often the case in his films."" ]";5

This is truly a testament to the film's quality and its ability to entertain to this day. A film that really ushered in the era of blockbusters, Jaws is still near the very top when considering the quality of summer blockbuster fare. The acting is solid, the story is engrossing, and the film never ceases to thrill and create scares thanks to a phenomenal score from John Williams and great direction from Steven Spielberg.

However, it eventually finally sank its teeth into me. First off, I loved the score. The score was so perfect for this film and really helped bring the film to life. In addition, the fight sequences were brilliantly choreographed and I also appreciate that while of course there has to be a lot of blood, it was never gratuitous. As for the acting, Russell Crowe did a really great job as Maximus, but for me, Joaquin Phoenix outshined him. Phoenix brought the consciously evil Commodus to life. I also loved seeing Tommy Flanagan in a small role here, as I love his current work in the TV series \""Sons of Anarchy\"". Another plus for this film was certainly the screenplay. Tons of quotable lines and great speeches really helped to amplify this film."", """", ""My complaints would likely center around the forced and unnecessary romance. It did not help move the film forward in the least. In terms of providing character history, it works, but as the action unfolds, it no longer really serves a purpose and felt like excess. In addition, the aforementioned slow beginning sequence was not overly to my liking, though I certainly understand why it is there and cannot complain over its conclusion. It simply did not provide the necessary spark to grab the viewers attention in my mind, but regardless, its importance is clear. Other than that, while typically top-notch, the CGI at times was noticeable with some unrealistic deaths along the way, but that is to be expected, as no film is perfect."", """", ""Overall, Gladiator is a very good film that proves that these types of films can be done successfully if enough work is put into them.

From the interactions between the band members to the lyrics in their songs, the comedy never stops here and really, you barely have time to recover between jokes. All of the band members, Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, are hilarious and turn in strong performances to boot. Rob Reiner is great here as well, as are Tony Hendra, June Chadwick, and then I really liked Bruno Kirby's small part as well. The fact that much of the dialogue was ad libbed makes this one even better and really helped to make it feel so natural. Spinal Tap is obviously not a real band, but it truly felt like it was at times since the interviews and interactions felt so natural and authentic. In every way imaginable, This Is Spinal Tap is a classic comedy from the 80's that is worthy of the praise it has received over the years."" ]";5

Everybody really embodies their character thanks to great casting all around. The direction from Sam Mendes is great and it is amazing to think that this was his debut. The script is very good. It is witty and dark at the same time. It is hard to place my finger on what the film is about. It is not overly complex, but there are so many things that are going on, that you cannot really say what this one is about in a sentence without leaving out a ton of information. But, I will try. Ultimately, to me, American Beauty is about life and the facade's we all put up around our lives to project an image of what we want we to be, rather than what we truly are. However, even in saying that, it leaves you a lot of the topics discussed, such as self-liberation, sexuality, and love. Yet, I think my simplistic sentence briefly covers all of those to some degree, as they all deal with pretending things are not what they are. In addition, I really love the title. There are so many different meanings behind \""American Beauty\"", whether it be the roses that are shown throughout the film, Mena Suvari's character, the beauty of the American Dream, or many other things. The film is not overly complicated, but has so many different plausible interpretations that it a fun film to dissect.

It really is heart wrenching at times to watch these people suffer. The direction is not the only strength, but also the acting. Julia Roberts is phenomenal, while Aaron Eckhart and Albert Finney are incredibly strong here as well. However, the writing is where this one falls apart. The characters are too thin and not fleshed out well enough in any regard. Even worse, Erin Brockovich is characterized as an annoying b***h who flies off the handle when somebody says one thing she does not like. Maybe she is really like that, but if she is, it really needed to be toned down for the film because it becomes grating.

1571;repo-man;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Born out of the counter-culture revolution, Alex Cox's Repo Man is a cynical, madcap, and absolutely absurd critique of the world of 1984 made by a man who had very little he liked and a very nihilistic view of the world around him. Set in small town California with young rebel Otto (Emilio Estevez) unwittingly having to remove his oversized earrings to become a repo man alongside Bud (Harry Dean Stanton), Repo Man is the kind of cultural critique that hits every possible area of American life to the point that it becomes a bit much. Fortunately, Repo Man's frantic pace, wacky plot, and delightfully odd characters, make it a film that as hard to resist as being offered by speed by a middle aged repo man as you cruise around town talking being repo men. Honestly, no film may better sum up 1980s cinema than Repo Man. Goofy effects, douchey young adults, Harry Dean Stanton, inventive ideas, and an anti-consumerist undercurrent running throughout the film."", ""Using the repo man profession as an entry into this wacky science fiction comedy, Repo Man is interesting in how little it actually focuses on science fiction. Aside from a few mentions of aliens or the possibility of getting a Chevy Malibu as a repo (which is the car carrying those aliens), much of this film is just Otto, Bud, and Lite (Sy Richardson) picking up cars. As a result, Cox is able to mock and criticize the consumerist culture we have in America. With people constantly pissed off at the fact their car is being taken even though it is their fault, Repo Man sets the tone by showing just how dumb people can really be. The poor buy cars they cannot afford or need. The rich buy cars and feel superior to having to pay them. To Cox, both of these sides are idiotic and those who get upset about losing their car in a repo deserve to get their ass whooped by a gang of repo men with bats. Yet, the reason is not because of capitalist ideology or anything of the like. Instead, it is based upon one's word. As Bud states, credit is the only thing in this world that really matters. It separates us from the communists, yes, and Cox clearly does not like communism as he openly mocks it and the idea of things being \""free\"", but the obligation to pay in the mind of Repo Man is not out of making the economy work. Rather, it is because somebody gave you money to buy something, thus you must pay them back. Credit shows how trustworthy a person is to return that money and, to the film, that defines a person's character. Somebody with bad credit is a bad person and vice versa. By not having credit as a way to determine somebody's trustworthiness, it makes communism inherently bad."", ""That said, in true nihilistic fashion, Cox hardly appreciates capitalism either. Critiquing the hustling televangelist who has Otto's parents in a trance and demands thousands of dollars in the name of God or by simply having Otto lament about television shows where people just consume, consume, and consume, Repo Man is a film that rails against consumerism and, by extension, capitalism. Showing the stress on society of a culture defined by what you have, the film shows the lengths people have resorted to as a result. With people not paying their cars, engaging in carjacking, or shooting people over repossessing their car, this car becomes an extension of who they are and how they define themselves, making it a personal affront to take it or to put obstacles in the way of them owning the car. This blase attitude to purchasing, in spite of consumerism, is really exemplified in the group of kids who go around engaging in robberies. Robbing the same store repeatedly, stealing the Chevy Malibu, and constantly questioning authority, the group is morally opposed to buying things, lest they appear poor. By stealing, they still get to identify themselves as members of this capitalist society and, by extension, as adults."", ""To a comedic degree, Repo Man consistently demonstrates just how immature these characters are by simply showing their interactions with one another. With criminals Duke (Dick Rude) and Debbi (Jennifer Balgobin) robbing stores, the two seem to really gel only when committing crimes. In one line, Duke demonstrates his maturity level by looking at Debbi and saying, \""Let's go get sushi and not pay.\"" Juvenile and a child's definition of living life on the edge and not paying, these robberies clearly make him and Debbi feel like adults. It gives them some control and a semblance of an adult life in spite of their childish surroundings and behavior. Underscoring these actions as ones from a wannabe adult, Cox shows Duke asking Debbi to \""have my baby\"" with the reasoning that it is what people seem to do from what he has noticed. These are lost kids, trying to find meaning in a world without any. By the time they are adults, the television-obsessed and consumerist adults have demonstrated two things has being marks of adulthood: having things and having kids. Who can blame these kids"" ]";5

It is also incredibly original, as it not everyday that you see a film that blends samurais and gangsters. This film is undeniably a fun and easy film to watch, in spite of the times when it does slow down. The only real \""negative\"" I can think of here is that the film is pretty safe for the most part. Yes, the idea it is based around is original, but for the most part, it feels like your regular old action crime film. Now, while I call that a \""negative\"", it is not really a bad thing since the film is still good, but it would have been nice to see them use the original idea to rise above the genre. Ultimately, however, it is a solid film that really sucks you in thanks to its original premise and solid directing/action/acting. Highly watchable without question."" ]";5

It features some really good acting from Christopher Walken in the lead role, as well as typically great direction from David Cronenberg. The writing is really good and it is very well paced. However, ultimately, I felt like the story was a little lacking. Though it had all these good pieces and the idea was really, really good,  it came together more like a by-the-numbers television series. Walken's character was essentially put in many different positions throughout the film and I think it would have been well-served if it chose one of these, rather than a bunch of them. The film tried to do much and made itself feel as though it were multiple different films, rather than one single film. In addition, I never found it scary. This isn't a negative, since I just expected a supernatural thriller, but I've seen it listed as a great horror film and I think I must have missed that aspect of it, as I found none of it that scary at all. Certainly, is unsettling, but never once was it scary. Overall, The Dead Zone is a pretty good film with good parts that could be even better if it was a more focused picture."" ]";5

Even if you do not like where the film goes, it is hard to admit it does not get those gears in your head to spin a bit. Stephen Rea, Forest Whitaker, and Jaye Davidson, are all phenomenal in a film that covers its topics with great sensitivity and respect throughout. Some call this a psychological thriller or a mystery film. If we are being honest, I have no idea how this is possible. It is not really mysterious nor is it a thriller. To me, it was more of a romance film set during the troubles, which adds a flair of war and some intrigue, sure, but no mystery. Maybe they mean mysterious romance?

The characterization here is very well done and very in-depth. Additionally, his development is very well done and his progression through the film is well handled. There are quite a few unrealistic scenes that hold the film back, but this film is quite well-written and has a ton of heart and will leave you with an infectious smile. Additionally, it has a lot of interesting and accurate commentary on guys of this nature. Jack Black also turns in a fantastic and energetic performance here in a film that, while offering social commentary, is also infused with classic music that really plays well into the infectious nature of the film.

The acting is good throughout, the action is very exciting and well done, the score is great, and the cinematography is gorgeous. The costumes are also very well done, even if completely historically inaccurate. The length is also very much justified as there is always enough going on to keep you fully wrapped up in the proceedings. However, even though all of those things are good to great, there is enough going wrong to take away from the overall product. Firstly, the violence, though not graphic, is entirely numbing. There is just too much of it and by the end, it loses all of its impact as you are so desensitized to it. Also, I just struggled as times with Mel Gibson here. He just does not look right, he just seems so out of place here. His acting was good and all, but I think somebody else could have fit the look better. Finally, the historical inaccuracies are bad. This is not inaccurate like a film like Inglourious Basterds is inaccurate, as that one has no false pretense of accuracy and is very much theatrical and gloriously inaccurate. Here, Braveheart does not necessarily pass itself off as accurate, but it certainly would like you to believe that it is and I simply cannot do so. If it was only a little inaccurate, then ok, but the blatant disregard for what happens is annoying to say the least. Overall, Braveheart is a pretty good film and is certainly worth a watch."" ]";5

Thanks to great acting from the ensemble cast featuring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Jeremy Blackman, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C.

It also does not hurt that the writing is superb and the depth we go to with these characters in just three hours is amazing. On that note, this one comes in at three hours and in spite of it, it feels like it was nothing more than an hour and a half, as the runtime just flies by.

Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Russell Brand, Mila Kunis, Paul Rudd, and Da'Vone McDonald, are all great in their respective roles. However, the writing here is the strongest part, as it manages to handle the raunchy jokes without letting the film turn into some nonsense teenage comedy.

As a stand alone film, it is technically brilliant and wonderfully acted. However, I did feel as though the direction could have been a bit more inspired. As is, Mongol was glacially slow at times and was a little too eager to have CGI blood effects. That being said, of course, Sergei Bodrov's direction of the battle sequences was fantastic, but the film really does a great job painting a picture of who Genghis Khan was before he became Khan. If something deserved to see its trilogy come to fruition, it is most certainly this film as it would honestly help bolster this one up a bit if it was able to be analyzed as merely one piece of a series.

Johnny Depp does a great job bringing this man to life and brings a certain tenderness and has fantastic chemistry with Winona Ryder when it comes to the romantic element of the film. The writing is incredibly strong and, together with Burton's direction, keeps this one reined in and keeps it from getting out of control when it easily could have with such a crazy premise. The characters are well developed and truly multi-dimensional. Edward Scissorhands' portrayal of suburban life also feels delightfully and quintessentially late 80s, early 90s and really serves as a perfect backdrop for the introduction of such a weird and unique person. Though I may be one of the few to have never seen Edward Scissorhands, it is truly timeless and will live on for a long, long time due to its fairy tale and thematic elements that really are universal and its ability to be both unique, yet incredibly stirring, tragic, and moving.

Honestly, it is like a cinematic fever dream to the point that it is nearly impossible to believe it is all actually happening."", ""Due to the film being an anthology, it is perhaps best to approach this differently than many of my other reviews. Given Allen's structure of a Q&A format, I will lift that for this review."", ""Q: Do Aphrodisiacs Work?"", ""A: Set in medieval England, court jester Woody Allen uses a love potion on the Queen only to meet some difficulty regarding her chastity belt. That said, the love potion certainly worked, so it is fair to say that aphrodisiacs do indeed work, but it is imperative to ensure that there are no other possible hiccups once your beloved is beholden to your every whim. A chastity belt to which neither of you have the key would certainly be a hiccup, as would getting your hand stuck on her ass through said chastity belt when her husband, the King, returns. Quite funny to watch to be sure, in large due to Allen's purposefully horrific stand-up routine for the King and the hijinx he gets into with the Queen, all while referencing Hamlet. Feels as though it hits all the beats of Allen's work to come later, but never necessarily as witty or smart as it may seem to think this sequence is. However, in saying that, it is certainly quite funny to watch due to the hilarious situation at hand and, as a result, this first question is a great way to start off the proceedings."", ""Q: What Is Sodomy?"", ""A: Gene Wilder gets into a torrid love affair with a sheep after a patient from Armenia asks for his assistance in getting Daisy the Sheep to start responding in the bedroom more. Yes, really. So, I guess it is best to answer this question by saying that sodomy is when a man gets really, really lonely in either the Armenian mountains or his loveless marriage, turns to a sheep for a refuge, and then gets sodomized by his wife in court as she takes all his money and loses his job. This is certainly a really, really weird section, but almost in a good way, especially when we see Wilder  in bed with Daisy as she wears a garter belt. It is quite the image and one that speaks to just how damn odd this sequence is, but that is entirely the point and given that it is rather funny, this section does work. That said, it may be the epitome of a litmus test for whether or not somebody loves weird cinema."", ""Q: Why Do Some Women Have Trouble Reaching an Orgasm?"", ""A: Allen's first attempt to really pucker up and kiss Federico Fellini's ass, this section stars him as an Italian man who cannot make his new wife orgasm. She is, allegedly, a virgin, in spite of her father giving Fabrizio (Allen) a map of all of her erogenous zones. As Allen discovers, the answer here is multi-fold. On one hand, perhaps it is the fault of the man or a lack of foreplay. Yet, if all else fails, clearly having sex in a department store must be the answer to solve these concerns. Funny and a nice send-up to Italian cinema, the sequence is probably the weakest to this point, but watching Allen and Louise Lasser getting busy under a dinner table is a truly great moment in cinematic history."", ""Q: Are Transvestites Homosexuals?"", ""A: Honestly no idea. I guess the answer here is no since Sam (Lou Jacobi) still loves his wife, but this one is clearly one that Allen had no idea how to really approach. It is probably insensitive, but given that it is from 1972, it is hard for the film to not be offensive in some way on this front. The sequence is not particularly funny and lands quite flat, though watching Sam climb out the window in women's clothing is kind of funny, but in a very Some Like It Hot kind of way where it is only funny because it is a man in women's clothing. Given by disdain for that film, it is no surprise that this segment is tied for my least favorite in the film. Not particularly funny and it keeps repeating the same jokes, lacking any of Allen's trademark wit. It does not really work and, combined with the section after, makes the middle of this film really drag."" ]";5

This one is an interesting mix of genres, all of which are used very well. In addition, the film is just very inspirational. At times, it can teeter to being a bit too cheesy, but the most part, everything here is clicking. This one is very moving at times and Washington does a great job playing the sympathetic character and really makes you feel horrible for the situation he found himself in. Now, the film does not appear to be an overly accurate portrayal of facts, but as it is a film, that is too be expected. The only thing that really stuck out that bothered me was there were some things that were odd, namely connections between events that were never made. There are not many of these, but they are crucial enough to be worth mentioning. In spite of that, however, The Hurricane is a very well made and brilliantly acted film that will undoubtedly move you."" ]";5
1585;all-about-my-mother;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Largely disappointing. The first film I have seen by Pedro Almodovar, All About My Mother still has me excited to check out the rest of his filmography, but this one is definitely flawed. A melodrama that is certainly partially an homage to films such as A Streetcar Named Desire and All About Eve, All About My Mother is a moving, tragic, and heart wrenching experience. With themes of parenthood, death, AIDS, transsexuality, and  faith, the film is an undeniably powerful experience. However, with a rushed ending and other moments of brevity throughout the film, All About My Mother loses some of its impact along the way."", ""Starring Cecilia Roth as Manuela, a grieving mother who recently lost her son, but has a mysterious past, the film explores her life after the death of her son. The film is an excellent exploration of her character and as she travels to find her son's transsexual father, Lola (Toni Canto). Never having told Lola she had a son (and named it Esteban, which was Lola's past name), Manuela travels to Barcelona, but meets a cast of characters along the way who alter her course. The purpose of the film may be to find Lola, but it spends far more time exploring Manuela's interactions with actress Huma (Marisa Paredes), transsexual prostitute Agrado (Antonia San Juan), and the HIV-positive and pregnant nun Rosa (Penelope Cruz). In the process, it explores the aforementioned themes and the stereotypes that perpetuate them."", ""Regarding AIDS and transsexuality, it is clear that there is an opposite reaction after the initial repulsion. People certainly look down upon both HIV-positive and transsexual people (even now) and All About My Mother captures this element. Yet, the film shows how people then have differing reactions to both. For those who are HIV-positive, such as Rosa, people are repulsed and want nothing to do with her. Her own mother, once Rosa gives birth, wants nothing to do with the child for fear that she will become HIV-positive as well. For transsexuals, they are still repulsed, but there is an inherent curiosity to this repulsion. Per Almodovar, people may not like transsexuals, but they find the blending of male and female private parts to be compelling and entirely erotic. The film shows how transsexuals must overcome these sexual advances to become what they really are: regular people who just happen to deviate from the norm."", ""The film blends these themes with themes of death and of faith. With Manuela's son dying and others dying from AIDS in the film, it is clear that death permeates the film. Through the melodrama, Almodovar wrings every possible ounce of tears out of the crowd, but he does lose some impact by skipping over death. He expects us to put it together, which we clearly can, but just hearing about it and seeing them die is entirely different. In this vein, the films brevity hurts it with these powerful moments losing all emotional impact due to his approach. With regards to faith, the power of God is ever present in this film. With His ability to heal highlighted toward the end, the film's thematic dealings with faith are clear through the presence of Rosa. A pregnant and HIV-positive nun, she is positively shown despite the juxtaposition. Selfless and willing to help people wherever needed, Rosa highlights the best of Christianity and, even if she has slipped into sin, there is forgiveness for her at the end of the day, even if her family is unwilling to accept her. For Almodovar, it is clear that faith is important in this film, but character triumphs all. Just because you are religious, it does not mean you are without sin, but your character means far more than any sins you may have committed."", ""A powerful melodrama, All About My Mother has a pretty poor ending where Almodovar just jumps ahead in time, losing all emotional impact, and just tells us what happened to characters. We see Manuela leave and come back after two years in five seconds, which is incredibly jarring. The film, in an attempt to cover its characters in greater depth without making the film longer, skims along at the end. For such a good film beforehand, it is disappointing to see Almodovar shorthand the ending and wind up crippling the final product. That said, the tremendous acting, writing, compelling themes, and unique colors and art direction, make the film a good one. I certainly hope my further exploration of Almodovar's filmography yields more enthusiastic results, however."" ]";5
1586;chasing-amy;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Chasing Amy is an incredibly funny, touching, and personal, film that, with the backdrop of potty humor, crafts a brilliantly mature and authentic relationship. Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams are both fantastic here and really capture the true essence of their characters and have great chemistry with one another. The writing and direction from Kevin Smith are both great, as is his cameo as Silent Bob with Jason Mewes as Jay. Both are hysterical here and use their brief appearance to its max potential. However, what holds this film back from being truly great is the ending. I appreciate the end result, but how it gets there is idiotic and nearly gave me a headache it was so truly dumb. This ultimately sullies the end product. Fortunately, the film is greatly entertaining and hysterical throughout so it is able to overcome this shortcoming. Overall, I really liked Chasing Amy and found it to be really, really funny."" ]";5

Plus, the added time allows us to spend more time with the characters, which is something I will never argue as a negative for this one. Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Doug Hutchison, Barry Pepper, Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, and James Cromwell, make up one hell of an ensemble cast for this one and all truly knock their roles out of the park. I am typically not a huge fan of prison dramas, but the heart and compassion you feel for everyone involved in amazing and truly draws you in. The more fantastical elements are also very interesting and set against the backdrop of a very realistic situation are all the more odd, but I think they are handled very well. As a whole, this one is very intriguing, touching, and unique, which elevate it above many prison dramas. Add in the great acting and you truly have something special with The Green Mile."" ]";5

Oddly enough though, it does have the look and feel of a Lynch film, even if it not as odd and flat out disturbing as his films typically are. Decidedly American, The Straight Story is a sweet and sentimental tale of a man who travels 240 miles on a lawn mower to visit his brother who is suffering from a stroke. With a great performance from Richard Farnsworth, The Straight Story is moving and incredibly entertaining, especially as the man visits a nice collection of characters whilst traveling. The cinematography is phenomenal, as are the mise en scene and score. The only problems I have with The Straight Story are the occasionally too slow pacing that bores more than entertains and, even worse, Sissy Spacek. I get that her character has a mental disability, but her performance is awful anyways. She is typically bad, but she outdid herself here with a career-worst performance. Wow is she awful. I could never understand what she said, regardless of her speech impediment. Annoying stuff. Overall, The Straight Story is a good and truly unique film from David Lynch that finds entertainment and beauty in such a simple premise."" ]";5

Galaxy Quest is everything a satirical film needs to be and expertly mocks sci-fi films such as Star Trek, while also providing unique entertainment of its own. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, and Justin Long, are all very good here and turn in equally hysterical performances. From beginning to end, Galaxy Quest is incredibly funny poking fun not only at the genre, but also at acting, fan bases, and Hollywood as a whole. Even better, it is not necessary to watch the films it spoofs here because the themes and jokes are easily accessible regardless. Overall, Galaxy Quest is a very entertaining and smartly made satire."" ]";5

The chemistry between Paul Newman and Robert Redford is infectious as one picks up right where the other left off the entire film. It was also unexpectedly quite funny, as the one liners were just priceless and show why the screenplay has received so much praise and why it deserves all of that praise. As with most of these classic westerns, the cinematography and set pieces were phenomenal and in this one, the action sequences were great and incredibly intense. The chase sequences were also great and I love how we are kept in the dark as to who is following them, just as they do not know. While I loved this, there were some definite negatives. First of all, there was no real plot, other than focusing on the exploits of Butch and Sundance, though it does not really go anywhere. Not a major complaint, but a complaint nonetheless. Another small complaint would be the pacing, as at times it got a tad too slow, but throughout much of the film, the slow pace was never that much of a problem. My main complaint would be Katharine Ross. Her acting here, in my opinion, was just flat out bad. I never really bought into her character and she was severely outclassed by her two legendary castmates."" ]";5
1591;little-shop-of-horrors;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Little Shop of Horrors is an incredibly 80s film. From the campy approach to everything and the cheesy special effects, Little Shop of Horrors not only embodies its 1960s setting, but also its status as a film in the 1980s. This element is bolstered by Rick Moranis, who is the quintessential awkward lead in many a 1980s comedy. Here, Moranis is charming as always as a clumsy, awkward, and unfortunate man who winds up getting tasked with caring for this murderous plant. The music and singing here are very good and the story, though simple, is nice and light which serves as a good backdrop for the comedy here. On that note, the film is hysterical at times, but consistently provides funny moments, which is all you can really ask of a comedy. With good music, an interesting premise, and consistent comedy, Little Shop of Horrors hits all of its marks."" ]";5

It can also be all over-the-map. Actually, it's just all over-the-map. A smattering of humor, philosophy, and silly Kevin Smith antics, Dogma is Kevin Smith at his most Kevin Smith.  Rife with sexual jokes, immature humor, Jay and Silent Bob antics, and interesting takes on life, Dogma is simply too inconsistent. As a comedy, it can be really funny, just not often enough. Far too many jokes are either too over-the-top or just not funny enough. Fortunately, the funny outnumber the unfunny, but the unfunny still take a noticeable place in the film. The acting is poor at times, though solid at others. The religious content is interesting at times, but just plain dumb at others. Essentially what I am saying is that Dogma is highly inconsistent on all fronts. If it had more of the good and less of the bad, it would be better. If only there was one less monster made of poop or if the logic in the film had continuity, or if the plot had continuity or if the logic had continuity, Dogma would be a solid film. As it stands, it is the remains of what could have been and even then, it is entertaining and well worth a watch."" ]";5
1593;the-last-temptation-of-christ;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The Last Temptation of Christ is an awkward film for me. I think it is a brilliant depiction of the battle between the spirit and flesh that takes place within believers, as alluded to in the opening quote of the film. Thus, the film is very good. It accomplishes this goal with precise skill thanks to Martin Scorsese's skill as a director and Willem Dafoe as an actor. Together they craft this image of a man tortured by the feeling that God wants something from him that he does not want to give. Rather, he wants to be a normal human man, but eventually, he realizes he truly just wants God. For this, The Last Temptation of Christ is brilliant. Where it becomes awkward for me is that this is a film about Jesus Christ. I do not know if this is a great depiction of Jesus in this sense. All that makes him a great depiction of humanity makes him a bad divine depiction. Thus, I am divided in this sense, much like Jesus is often believed to be. From a technical standpoint though, the portrayal and dedication to such is fantastic. Scorsese crafts this really human Jesus who really has the same temptations as everyone else (\""Son of Man\"") and really makes the character's religious struggles incredibly relatable. While watching the film, I was incredibly mixed as I watched the film, especially with the odd dream sequences for the temptations and odd depictions of the divine, but when I saw what the film was going for at the end, I gained an appreciation for it that lacked while I watched it. Thus, I really liked The Last Temptation of Christ. It is not a film you can watch pieces of. as without the full picture, you will be lost. Scorsese's direction is masterful as always and Willem Dafoe is phenomenal as Jesus. Overall, the film is a brilliant technical work and phenomenal character study."" ]";5

First off, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are phenomenal here, especially Norton who really makes for an appealing lead, in spite of all of his clear issues. While the things in this film are certainly not something to be worshipped or thought highly of, the film takes these wrong and evil acts and truly makes a beautiful film out of it. On the surface, it is about two men who makes a club where they just beat the crap out of one another, but it is really about so much more than that and it is cool to see them use that fight club as a cover for what the film is truly about. David Fincher's vision for this one is a great one and he directs this film brilliantly. In addition, the set pieces are perfect for the film and all look incredibly well done and appropriate for the film. Overall, Fight Club lived up to the hype for me, hooking me in from the very beginning and never letting go until the film was over."" ]";5

In many ways, it is truly brilliant. In others, it merely odd and tries to find new ways to out-odd itself. Yet, I cannot help but feel that I truly loved this film. From beginning to end, it is hysterical and its unique concept is accurately explored. Even better, it leads to so many questions about existence, free-will, the self, and many other postmodern ideas. One thing is for sure though: Being John Malkovich is wonderfully written. With great characters and incredible execution of such a weird idea, this one shows why Charlie Kaufman should be revered as one of the best living screenwriters. His wonderfully odd imagination plays out in his films and this one is no exception. The acting is fantastic, especially John Cusack, Catherine Keener, and John Malkovich. While undeniably weird, Being John Malkovich is a delightful door into the human mind that explores what makes us tick, what makes us human, and makes you incredibly paranoid that somebody is in your head."" ]";5

In David Lynch films, if something can be weird, it will be weird. This is very much the case in Blue Velvet, especially in scenes with Dennis Hopper, who is incredible here in an entirely unhinged performance. Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, and Laura Dern, are also all really good. Honestly, though this one is weird, I found it to be one of the more straight forward David Lynch films. Sure, there is a lot beneath the surface here that I cannot even begin to understand, but unlike in his other works I have seen, there is a plotline I can follow and understand without having to dive too deep to derive meaning here, which I liked. Though, this one certainly could be a fun one to analyze upon further viewings. Incredibly symbolic (robins, anyone?), Blue Velvet is a brilliantly written and directed piece of work that is incredibly unsettling, but entirely gripping throughout."" ]";5

It is pretty funny at times, though I did not find it funny throughout and it can definitely be a little thrilling at times, which added to the entertainment. The cast is alright, nothing special. The set is really cool and sports a lot of stuff from the board game itself which, again, I found very cool. The elements added into the film to have things make sense worked pretty well I thought and though this one can be slow in the beginning, once things get going, it is anything but.

The cinematography is also good here, which is a nice plus, as well as the very convincing makeup on Crowe. However, aside from Crowe's acting, the real star here is undeniably Mann and his ability to create satisfying thrills. Throughout, you are on the edge of your seat awaiting what will happen next and that really makes for an exciting and enjoyable experience. The length is always fine and while it slows down at times, it never really drags like films that hit the 2:30 mark sometimes do.

The backstory, pacing, and the way in which the scares are created, are all great and interesting. What I also enjoyed is the curiosity surrounding the poltergeists in the home that the family has before things start to get scary. This one can get a little silly at times for sure, but is brilliant all the same and though the ending is odd as all get out, it remains scary.

1601;showgirls;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Cited by some as one of the worst films of all-time, Showgirls' reputation has improved markedly in the past few years. From being accepted to \""so bad it's good\"" to a \""guilty pleasure\"", the film has now received a critical re-evaluation. Many critics and directors have come out and defended the film as a brilliant work of satire, which it most certainly is. Famed critic Jonathan Rosenbaum has praised it as an allegory for selling out in Hollywood. While it most certainly could be an allegory and is a satire, I believe that Showgirls is most closely aligned with a critique of the sex industry. Showing girls selling their bodies as hookers, strippers, and showgirls in seedy Vegas hotels, Showgirls is a full bodied critique of the sex industry. Derided as misogynistic and exploitative trash, Showgirls is certainly both of those, but it has to be in order to show the dark repercussions of the industry."", ""As an erotic drama, the film was criticized for not being erotic enough. Yet, that is entirely the point. The film starts off somewhat erotic, but by the end, we see the dark rewards reaped by eroticism and the warped perception of women that men have. As these women snap off their tops without prodding, men walk away with the belief that they own and possess the female body. It is their personal playground to do whatever they like. Men such as Andrew Carver (William Shockley) emphasize this with him raping a girl towards the end of the film. He could have had sex with her anyways. She was definitely going to, but he likes the power that comes with ownership. He feels as though he owns women and is unwilling to cede this control. By letting her make a consensual decision to sleep with him, he concedes that she is his equal and well, in the world of the sex industry, that is simply not allowed. Women exist solely for our entertainment and to reveal their breasts while dancing is their only contribution to society. Dark, exploitative, and unflinching in this depiction, Verhoeven shows the horrors that the sex industry breathes. It feeds into the rape culture that plagues our nation and asserts that, yes, women are nothing but male playthings."", ""However, it can become even more horrifying. The protagonist, Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley), meets a man named James Smith (Glenn Plummer) early in the film. James is hardly a good guy and definitely exploits women sexually throughout the film. Yet, he does hit the nail on the head in one conversation with Nomi. He argues that places like strip clubs are alright, because they do not lie to you. The women are selling their bodies and the men are buying. It is erotic dances in a Vegas hotel, such as the show \""Goddess\"" that Nomi wants to be in, that are bad. They pretend they are art and the patrons pretend they want art, but instead they give you the women's bodies anyways. It is lying and still just as exploitative. This is certainly true of the shows at the Stardust Hotel, in which the show solely consists of women ripping off their tops and dancing half-naked. This parallel is revealed by Zack (Kyle MacLachlan) when he reveals Nomi's past. A former hooker who only cost $50-$100 a pop, Zack tells her that she has low self-esteem and sells herself short. Yet, hooking is still very much her job, she just does not have sex with patrons anymore. From stripping at the Cheetah to dancing at the Stardust, the save product is for sale: her body. The only difference is that the line of work she does now is legal. The show also shows itself to be exploitative with the girls being propositioned for sex by workers at the hotel to satisfy important customers and famed Vegas showgirl Crystal Connors (Gina Gershon) being dumped to the curve after an injury. Once they are done with you, they will throw you without hesitation. But, it is almost preferable to when they do want you, as they treat you as a sub-human sex toy."", ""The film cements itself as a critique and satire of the sex industry with a sign outside of James' apartment. Reading \""Jesus is Coming Soon\"", this simple sign is a call for help from the sex industry. Having seen Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed for the same antics as those found in Las Vegas, it is a warning to heed the word of the Bible before it is too late. Exploiting women's bodies for over-stimulation and titillation is putting the city and the people in a hand basket destined for Hell. This also drives at why the film is not supposed to be erotic, but rather exploitative. Verhoeven rips open blouses repeatedly to show you the horror of the situation these girls find themselves in. Though they may be smart or talented, their only value is their breasts and there seems to be solemn knowledge of this fact possessed by the women. Yet, this knowledge is juxtaposed by an urgent warning to shape up and repent as Jesus will soon arrive and Vegas will most certainly be left behind."" ]";5

The hour proceeding is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it certainly does not reach the heights of that last half hour. This one is told in a very unique way that really captures the disjointed thoughts of our protagonist and the confusion he faces as he tries to find out what happened to his daughter. As is usual, director Steven Soderbergh handles this unique storytelling like a champ and directs this one quite well. Terrence Stamp is great in the lead role and does a great job of capturing this mysterious feeling surrounding his character as nobody truly knows who this man is or his entire past.

Well directed by M. Night Shyamalan, this one manages to be scary, touching, and above all, incredibly entertaining. There are numerous scenes here that manage to do all three, but above all, I found this film to be incredibly moving. A study of ghosts (and what they want), as well as the mind of troubled children, The Sixth Sense manages to really move its audience in a truly unexpected way. I did not expect to be practically moved to tears by this one, but there I was, fighting back tears towards the end. Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette, are all great here, especially Osment who really shows how talented of an actor he is. It also underscores how sad it is that Shyamalan lost his magic touch, since this one shows so much talent. Truly a great film, The Sixth Sense is another top-notch entry in what was a fantastic year for film in 1999."" ]";5

Many war films do not really have character development and this one did not have a ton, but it at least had some to let us know the motivation behind the main characters' actions. However, the narrative slacks at times and can be a tad boring at times for my liking and even when it was not, I was never fully gripped by what was happening. It was certainly interesting enough, but the plot was a tad too outlandish and predictable for me to fully enjoy it.

With great cinematography, great writing, and terrific performances from Diane Keaton and Mariel Hemingway, Manhattan is already ahead of most films of this kind. However, the reason that I did not love it to the level I expected that I would be due to a few things. For one, Woody Allen's character is whiny to the point of pure annoyance in this one. I do not remember him being this damn whiny in Annie Hall, which turned me off immediately. Second, it was neither as funny or as romantic as one would expect from a film of this kind. It was romantic and funny at times, but never to the level that it should have been. Finally, the plot is so damn creepy. A 42 year old man dating a 17 year old girl? Jesus, Woody Allen let's be a little more subtle please. Regardless, as I said, the writing, imagery, and acting, are all impeccable, which really alleviate most of my concerns, and the direction from Woody Allen is very good as well as it perfectly paced and told very well. Overall, Manhattan is a very good film that does not feel as though it came out in 1979."" ]";5

While the premise is not overly original, it is so incredibly well done that it makes this one impossible to truly ignore. Even more, the film is quite tight. Everything it introduces has a purpose and everything has a point, which I love. There is simply no clutter here and every line means something more for the plot than it may initially seem. On the whole, Stir of Echoes may be a typical psychological horror film, but it is so well written and so effective at eliciting fear that it makes it impossible to ignore at all."" ]";5

As brilliant as all of his preceding work, Eyes Wide Shut is a dreamlike film that relies on his really intense and unsettling atmosphere for thrills to great effect. I truly have little idea about what went on, other than the obvious basics and some ways beyond that, but this one is truly a unique experience. Tom Cruise is great, as is Sydney Pollack. Nicole Kidman is not as good as the rest of the cast, but she is not bad either. Packed to the brims with little subtleties and little symbols, this one strikes me as one that I need to watch again down the line, but based on just one viewing, I can already say that I really, really like this film. Intense, brilliant, thrilling, and undeniably erotic, Eyes Wide Shut is a film that truly messes with your head and enjoys doing so."" ]";5

I really liked the way the story was told with hints towards the future and the multiple stages of Salvatore's life. The production design is also great, as is the score. My one complaint is the lack of depth to Salvatore's love of a girl named Elena. Symbolically, it makes sense, but I'd still like to see more, but regardless, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of the film.

The cinematography, costume design, production design, and makeup, however, are all the heroes of this film and help to create a rapturously beautiful film. That said, the pacing can be off at times and the film is nowhere near as endearing as other, better, Austen adaptations.

While the subtext is not exactly subtle in any sense of the word, it is still a great message. However, where this film really blows you away is in the characterization of its robot protagonists and the way it makes you feel their emotions. A truly romantic and epic journey of two robots who fall in love, WALL-E is incredibly adorable and powerful, all while the world surrounding the robots is entirely lethargic and barren. While the message of the film is good, this relationship and the way they make them come to life without either robot speaking a single word absolutely stunned me. Additionally, it did a great job blending what appeals to the kids and what appeals to the adults very well and made a very family friendly film that will leave everyone feeling satisfied. Overall, WALL-E is a fantastically made and incredibly powerful film that will leave you wanting to get up off the couch and sit down and watch a movie with lots of dancing and singing."" ]";5

I have seen many a horror/thriller and this one had me on pins and needles throughout. While it lacks true scares, director Roman Polanski repeatedly crafts a deliciously creepy and unsettling atmosphere dripping with mystery. As the film is unveiled, it continues to be compelling especially when Depp is on the search for the books and when he deals with the girl. Really the only moments that do not pay off are the final 20 minutes that simply feel awkward and clumsy, though the very ending is an interesting touch. That said, The Ninth Gate features a great performance from Depp and though inferior to Rosemary's Baby (obviously) and Chinatown (due to its neo-noir elements), it demonstrates Polanski's immense skill while working with mystery and horror, especially together. A devilishly mysterious and creepy thriller, The Ninth Gates more than satisfies."" ]";5

Beyond this, it is a very solidly crafted film with a tight plot that remains focused on the joy, pain, anguish of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. In this role, Knightley is a real highlight reel with a terrifically nuanced performance that really captures the essence of England's \""it girl\"" of the late 1700s. She really radiates charisma in this film and attracts the eyes, as is appropriate. Ralph Fiennes also turns in a good performance here as her manipulative and cruel husband. Overall, The Duchess hits the breaks more than it should, but does a fantastic job crafting a portrait of this beloved figure."" ]";5
1613;midnight-cowboy;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Dark, grimy, and disturbing, Midnight Cowboy is not exactly the film I thought it was going to be. I knew it was about a male prostitute, but I thought both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman were going to be prostitutes, not just Voight. It was also my assumption that he was not some wannabe prostitute who does not really work, but rather an established one in New York City. Naturally, in line with this, my expectation was to see a lot more sex than I actually got. Now, none of these are bad things, in fact rather good. By not meeting these expectations, Midnight Cowboy manages to actually tell a far more interesting story of a young, hurt Texan boy coming to New York City to try to become a prostitute and meeting an ill loser with a limp who becomes his best friend. As a startling counter-point to the American dream at the height of the Vietnam War, Midnight Cowboy is a very good character study and a pure technical showcase for director John Schlesinger."", ""With this young Texan cowboy Joe Buck (Jon Voight), Midnight Cowboy creates the quintessential American male. Name dropping Gary Cooper or John Wayne as similar ideals of what a man is supposed to be, it is only natural that in the counter-culture 1960s, Schlesinger would take this example of masculinity and throw him into situations unfit for men. Sleeping with women as a prostitute or even partaking with some men when times are hard, as well as going to seedy underground parties with drugs, Joe Buck seems to be a man who could not be further from the old school definition of masculinity even if his look and style of dress say otherwise. Compounding this, he steals readily. Inspired by friend Enrico \""Ratso\"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), Buck begins to rob people or steal small items to attempt to get any small number of funds for the two of them, Buck flies in the face of classic cowboy western stars Cooper and Wayne. Known for playing Sheriffs or simply passer-bys who fight against men who steal land/cattle from others, Cooper and Wayne are strictly on the \""right\"" side of morality. Buck, however, by trading in sex and stealing stands as the complete foil to those classic men, to the degree that he would be an appropriate antagonist in one of their films. Schlesinger certainly hints at this dark villainy by the film's title of Midnight Cowboy. Dark and ominous, the addition of \""Midnight\"" makes it read as being the darker version of a cowboy and, as it plays out, it is very appropriate."", ""In the process, Midnight Cowboy stands as a critique of the American dream. With a small town boy coming to the big city on a bus ride that takes him through quintessential American items - commercial billboards, oil, diners, etc. - the film presents Americana and then shows the polar opposite: the dark underbelly. Showing how this unassuming and innocent boy is quickly corrupted and spit out by the big city, the film shows Joe's journey from renting a small hotel room to being kicked out and having to stay in a condemned building with Ratso. Going from the penthouse in which he spends an afternoon with a rich cougar to the literal sewer with a man nicknamed rat, Joe goes from king of the hill to bottom of the heap in no time whatsoever. As easily as he walked in, New York City and its high barriers to entry spit him out into the gutter with drug-infested parties, dirty homes, and grime around every corner. On the surface, for men such as Joe or others who journey to the big city to achieve their dreams, it all seems so easy. Once they arrive, however, the city and its machinations put up barriers all around that make \""making it\"" a challenge few can accomplish. Unfortunately for Joe, he is not one of those and, as a result, he must live in what can only be defined as \""squalor\"" on a good day."", ""To capture the horrors seen by Joe - even if he does not believe them to be horrors - Schlesinger uses hectic and pretty nifty camera work throughout. Constantly cutting with jarring flashbacks revealing Joe's horrifying past in Texas with his unstable girlfriend, Midnight Cowboy can really only be described as a kaleidoscopic descent into the madness of this grimy and dark world of sin that he has found himself trapped within. Yet, perhaps most interesting is the party sequence. Using what is best described as a picture-in-picture approach at times, Schlesinger shows a shrunken version of the shot in the middle of the screen with the blown up, out-of-focus version of that shot playing in the background. It is deeply unsettling, off-putting, and greatly unique to watch. It really captures the mind-altering and vision-altering impact of drugs and makes what is already a deeply unsettling sequence to watch feel even grimier and more distorted."" ]";5

Funny, adventurous, and romantic, there are not many demographics that are missed here. Incredibly well-written and quite well-directed by Rob Reiner. The film's pacing is quite assured and could be well-advised to cool off a bit, especially in the beginning, but it is never truly a glaring problem. Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, and especially Billy Crystal are all great and turn in hilariously over-the-top performances. The sequence with Crystal stands out as the best in the film due to its comedic elements. On that note, the film is not quite as funny as I anticipated, but is very, very funny all the same. It expertly blends this comedy with a captivating adventure tale and a very touching and well-crafted romance fitting for its fairy tale approach. Overall, The Princess Bride is a classic for a reason and it is not hard to find out why: charm."" ]";5

A classic of 1980s teen comedy, director Amy Heckerling manages to craft a terrific teen film in her directorial debut. Given her later struggles as a director, aside from Clueless, it is clear she is most adept when handling female protagonists. Fast Times at Ridgemont High really highlights this with some truly terrific females characters, as well as some good supporting male characters. All-in-all, the film is a funny, authentic, and loose look at teenagers in the 1980s and, really, any decade. With good performances all around, Fast Times at Ridgemont High remains a classic of the coming of age genre."", ""Featuring an ensemble cast led by Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stacy Hamilton (kind of), Fast Times at Ridgemont High's greatest accomplishment is its authentic characters. Coaxed into believing sex is all that matters, Stacy begins toying around with the idea until an abortion, Stacy is the typical high school girl. Immature and unsure of what she wants, she assumes she wants what her closest friend claims to want as well. That is until she meets Mark Ratner (Brian Backer). Hilariously awkward, Mark is really my spirit animal. In particular, the scene where he is about to close the deal with Stacy after their first date and they wind up looking at a photo album instead. This moment, though it has never happened to me, really spoke to me on a personal level. Mark is awkward, yet a good person. Though Stacy first overlooks him even though she does find him attractive, she comes to see how great he could be. This is not a classic \""nice guy\"" scenario where he is just nice to her in the hopes she will begin to look him. Rather, there is a mutual attraction from the beginning, highlighting just how well-written these characters are, even for 1982. This is not a classic creepy Hollywood romance. Instead, it is authentic and realistic."", ""Stacy's best friend Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates) is equally well-written. Nailing the girl who believes she is wise beyond her years, Linda acts as though she is a sexual professional while speaking about her mysterious fiance in Chicago. Along the way, she convinces Stacy to think the same way that she does. In reality, odds are that Linda does not actually have sex with anybody, even if she does believe herself to be a mature adult. There is always one of these kind of people in high school and Linda really embodies this personality. On the flip side, we have Mike Damone (Robert Romanus) who believes himself to be a ladies man. In reality, he is incredibly inexperienced and does not know what to do at all when it comes to women. Similarly to Linda, Mike believes himself to be incredibly mature, even if he still has a lot of growing up to do."", ""These are just tidbits of the terrific characters in the film who are all incredibly authentic, while also very well acted. In particular, Sean Penn shines as Jeff Spicoli, the stoned slacker. Always disconnected, confused, and stoned, Penn really nails the character and how laid back the \""druggy\"" of the school always ends up being. Really, the way in which the film manages to develop its wide array of characters and make them all incredibly authentic is very impressive. As one watches the film, there are numerous moments where you can sit back and point to people these characters remind you of. This is really Heckerling and writer Cameron Crowe's greatest accomplishment here: authenticity. With some teenage coming of age movie cliches under its belt, the film manages to overcome them with great authenticity."", ""Largely a stream of consciousness style film, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a very funny, incredibly realistic, and fast paced coming of age film. With good performances all around, the film is both incredibly enjoyable and insightful as to the obsession with sex possessed by high school students."" ]";5
1616;young-frankenstein;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A goofy and silly Mel Brooks spoof on Frankenstein and gothic horror, Young Frankenstein is obviously a classic of the genre and one of those films that everybody should see at least once. Quite funny and silly along the course of its runtime, Young Frankenstein largely mirrors the plot of the original text by Mary Shelley and film by James Whale, aside from how it starts, even seguing perfectly into the original's sequel Bride of Frankenstein at the end of the film. Introducing us to Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder), a normal scientist who is ashamed of his grandfather Victor, arrives in Transylvania to bury his grandfather only to stumble onto his book of his re-animated life research and how-to guide. Reading it and falling in love with the idea, he steals a body and brain to create his Monster (Peter Boyle). With the help of hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and hot girl Inga (Tori Gerr), he must create his creature, keep him in the castle, and keep him from the villagers."", ""Witty as always, gags throughout the film deliver great laughs even when they are impeccably silly or simple. With Igor's hunch constantly switching sides, it shows the attention-to-detail that Mel Brooks was always known for, while also delivering excellent laughs. Constant jokes about the Monster's lengthy member may be a bit juvenile, but somehow Brooks makes it come off. As was always the case, this pairing of Brooks and Gene Wilder was a match made in heaven with the two in perfect harmony throughout with Wilder able to deliver the script's witty lines and comical moments with great zip and timing. As with any Brooks spoof/parody film, Young Frankenstein is simply an easy watch with smart comedy that consistently delivers laughs or smirks throughout the film. Kooky, outrageous, and constantly enjoyable, Young Frankenstein simply works as a comedy spoof of gothic horror films."", ""That said, compared to Brooks' other hits I have seen, Young Frankenstein is not nearly as funny. Not as witty as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein is still funny, but not nearly as funny. Instead, much of it relies on the silly situations the characters find themselves in, which elicits smiles or chuckles, but never laughs. Compared to Blazing Saddles, which was littered with hysterical comedic moments, Young Frankenstein is never uproariously funny. Light, smart, and definitely funny, but Young Frankenstein is more about situational comedy instead of the witty banter form of comedy that I personally prefer. As such, the comedy in Young Frankenstein is good, but simply not my style the entire time. As a result, this one did underwhelm a bit in that regard considering my previous exposure to Brooks was so excellent and memorable."", ""What is excellent, however, is the detail of the film, especially in the production design. Capturing the look and feeling of a gothic horror film, Young Frankenstein's set pieces were perfect for a horror film. With rotating book cases, creepy candles and looming rooms, weird contraptions, creepy photos, and even more unsettling workers in the home, every piece of this film's set and structure captures the mood the film is going for perfectly. Sinister and imaginative, these elements make this a parody/spoof of a genre that actually often works as a realization of that genre. The key highlight being Frederick and Inga searching for the mysterious music in the home. While goofy with the hidden passageways, the film nonetheless conjures up a creepy atmosphere that is filled with anticipation for what could be lurking right around the corner. Visually, the film is equally as stunning, making use of German expressionist lighting throughout. With dark shadowy corners lurking about the set piece, the film's stylish photography and lighting delivers on the atmosphere the film aims to create and further the feeling that dark, ominous occurrences are afoot in the film."" ]";5

This death reveals many things and leads to changes for the town residents who must solve the mysteries of the past to fix themselves. With a terrific leading performance from Chris Cooper, the film has an incredibly strong supporting cast that really add to the feel of this Texas border town. Lone Star is so poetic and cinematic that even its setting reveals more of the film's thematic elements and really plays into what the film is attempting to communicate.

Maybe not unique for director Peter Weir, who is known for his slow and contemplative dramas, but definitely unique for star Harrison Ford. No action, no fight scenes, and no archaeological digs. This is a straight drama and Ford was rewarded by it being the only film he starred in to lose money. Playing eccentric inventor Allie Fox, The Mosquito Coast depicts Allie taking his family to Belize where he buys a small village. Fed up with American life and the perceived failure of it as a society, he sees the small village of Jeronimo as a paradise where they can start over. Unfortunately, things go haywire as he gets more-and-more erratic in his behavior. A slow descent into madness, Ford turns in possibly his best acting performance in the film and it is a film with various thematic layers courtesy of Weir."", ""One of the most readily apparent themes at play in the film is the perceived failure of the American dream. Winding down to the point where people buy things they do not need and sells things to people who also do not need them, commercialization has superseded ambition. Driving past migrant workers in America, Fox laments to his two sons - Charlie (River Phoenix) and Jerry (Jadrien Steele) - that he has no idea why they keep coming here. They work their asses off and for what? Nothing but abject poverty. Constantly complaining about the way in which America has spiraled downward into being practically a parody of itself, Allie Fox is a man who eventually proves just how hard it is to build a society. In Jeronimo, he builds his ice machine that produces ice from fire and provides preservation for food and air conditioning, but his greed and pride lead him to abusing his machine to kill intruders. Backfiring, he winds up quickly destroying his settlement. Viewed in comparison with the theme of the failed American dream, Fox essentially answers his own question. He works hard to build himself up with no expectation of monetary reward. He does it because he has to and he views this place as his best chance for happiness. For immigrants, their reasons are very much the same. Unfortunately, infrastructure of the country they arrive in winds up blowing up in their face and knocking them back down to square one."", ""Early in the film, Allie also rants about the world. Stating that war has changed immeasurably, he believes that no longer is either side entirely innocent in war. Rather, both sides are different shades of evil. This belief comes to fruition when he battles Reverend Spellgood (Andre Gregory). Bringing Christianity to the area via his missionary, he and Allie do battle and the Reverend accuses Allie of being a communist. Bringing Allie's villagers to his settlement and unafraid to use a gun and kill people, the Reverend is hardly a good man. His own daughter, who befriends Charlie, hardly even likes him. Yet, Allie himself is a murderer and a dangerous psychopath. For both, they felt the call to come out to this area in Belize - the Reverend because of God and Allie because of his rejection of American society - yet they quickly discover there is not enough room for the both of them. Mirroring war, they both quickly divide their settlements and stay the hell away from one another and neither are particularly good people with both exacting violence on one another and their settlements."", ""As is clear, communism, the red scare, and nuclear holocaust also play a key thematic role in the film. Accused of being a communist, Allie also tells his children that America was destroyed by a nuclear bomb after previously warning that nuclear holocaust was on its way. In the mid-1980s, the red scare may not have been nearly as prevalent as in the 1950s, but it certainly was still around and Allie plays on this paranoia with his own children. Unfortunately for him, he brings nuclear holocaust to Jeronimo with his inventions that pollute the water. The end result being that it is not machines or the warheads we need to be wary of, but the people in control of them. His machine would not have exploded had he not used it for his own nefarious purposes out of greed, pride, and anger. In essence, he was the reason for hellfire coming to his settlement and opened himself up to punishment for his own inclination to fall into excess. Similarly, nuclear holocaust would not be a fear if it were not for the people willing to use them for nefarious purposes. Nuclear energy could be used for good just as his machine could be used for good, but its purpose is perverted and used to promote various agendas or criminal enterprises."", ""Thematically important, The Mosquito Coast may be too slow for some, but it is undeniably riveting to watch unfold. Thrilling, dramatic, and horrifying, Allie Fox's descent into pure insanity and into a dangerous man is hard to watch and a compelling character study of a man who subtly becomes the evil he was warning his kids about in the beginning."" ]";5

While hardly revolutionary, the film is incredibly fun to watch and very funny from beginning to end, plus it has more going on in its mind than many a high school film. Alicia Silverstone is terrific in the lead role and really plays the role of the popular and vapid high school girl. There is honestly not much to say about this one. Quintessentially 1990s, Clueless brings the charm and wit of a 1980s John Hughes teen classic and updates it for the 90s. If only there were movies like this nowadays."" ]";5

The writing is also strong, but ultimately, I just felt like this one meandered a bit. All of it is an exercise in ethics and morals, sure, but I wish it stayed more focused on the election rather than focusing on the personal life of Broderick's character or past events at the school. Adding a bit more depth to the race for Student Government President and disregarding other events a bit would ultimately result in a better film in my mind (though obviously some of the events I wish to shrink are necessary, but I don't think they needed to play as much of a role in the overall story as they did).

Grunick, however, is clueless as to what causes his success and has no idea what he is doing minute-by-minute. Hurt expertly captures this aloof quality of the character and it is the basis on which his entire performance is based. In every moment of his life, Grunick is lost and a mere look at Hurt's face clues you into the degree of his confusion. This is why his performance is so good."", """", ""As producer Jane Craig, Holly Hunter is also tremendous, however. The exact opposite of Grunick, Jane is the smartest person in the room. She knows it and expects everyone else to know it, yet she finds it burdensome that she can be so overbearing to those around her. There is also a significant chip on her shoulder for being a woman in a man's world, which certainly shows. Through Jane, writer/director James L. Brooks explores what it is like for a woman entering this scenario and Hunter really brings her to life. At every turn, she feels as though she is being challenged or tested by those around her and the end result is a certain neurosis she appears to be plagued by. It is as if she is about have a mental breakdown due to the chaos she attracts due to her demeanor. Hunter does a great job balancing the brilliance of Jane with her challenge to fit into this unknown world."", """", ""Albert Brooks is also quite good, though often upstaged here. Yet, he really shines through in one scene with Jane in which he expresses his feelings for her. Here, Brooks reveals the true nature of his character, Aaron Altman. Always the smartest in the room as well, Altman is unlike Jane in that he never fulfilled his potential. He was book smart, but not street smart. As the opening shows, he has always said the wrong thing at the wrong time, no matter how old he was. He certainly expects the world to cater to him and he is not afraid to show it, even when it comes to Jane. Yet, his brilliance is clear and he is very talented at his job. Brooks does a great job at making the character truly funny at times, especially with his delivery. At the same time, he balances this terrifically with his superiority complex at work and inferiority complex in love."", """", ""The romance here is also incredibly well developed, even if there is no pay-off, which is fine. Though the characters have incredible chemistry, the film would have been disingenuous if it had that big pay-off at the end of every romantic film. Tom Grunick is a jerk. Aaron Altman is a jerk. Jane is better off on her own without either of them and James L. Brooks is not afraid to end his film in this fashion, which certainly takes a lot of guts in the world of film. However, much like her approach to journalism, Jane must stay true to herself and not compromise her own values for the sake of somebody else. This shines through and even if it feels unsatisfying because we have been trained to expect a certain thing from romances, it is the correct ending for the film."", """", ""Funny and full of criticism of the news media, Broadcast News is a terrifyingly true film, both in its criticism of the journalists in this country and of romance."" ]";5

Additionally, I wish more of the character motivations and backstories had a bit more depth, because as is, it felt very cartoonish with vague motivations and just needlessly evil characters (who are bloodthirsty too?). So, this odd and poor characterization does detract from the film a bit, but the rest is so touching and wonderfully crafted, it is impossible to ignore.

Featuring excellent puppetry alongside this story of a young girl going to rescue her little brother (talk about a gender swap) from the Goblin King (David Bowie), Labyrinth is raucous fun that is highly imaginative, nicely acted, and a great fairy tale for the modern age even if it can get a little too odd at times."", ""The times in which it gets a little too odd are largely delivered via song. With David Bowie or various puppets breaking into spontaneous and decidedly random moments of song, the film halts too much. Not only do the songs contribute very little to nothing at all to the film, but the songs are very odd (one about removing a girl's head) and never really captures the imagination. Instead, it feels like stomping on the brake and brings the film to a screeching halt. Had the music been good, it would have been excusable, but the songs are just not interesting lyrically and go on for far too long. The end result is a film that can sometimes feel too broken up and disjointed to wind up matching its fantastical feeling. Instead, it feels like a childhood fantasy film interspersed with songs that got left on the cutting room floor of the latest David Bowie album."", ""Fortunately, as a fairy tale, Labyrinth is nonetheless impressive thematically. Written by Terry Jones of Monty Python fame, it should be no surprise that he writes some similar morals to fellow Monty Python member Terry Gilliam. In his film Time Bandits, Gilliam went heavily anti-materialistic and with Labyrinth, Jones does the exact same. The highlight example of this theme comes as young Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) bumps into a woman in a trash heap. The woman has various pieces of garbage on her back and has been sent by the Goblin King to try and distract Sarah from her quest to rescue her brother. Tricking her into going into her room at home by enticing her with some her possessions, the woman begins placing various toys and clothes on Sarah's back while urging her to just stay and forget about Toby. With her possessions literally creating a weight on her back due to the value she places upon these material goods, Sarah is forced to decide between being crushed by the weight of this material greed or breaking free and relying upon human connection as a means to fill in her heart. This materialistic nature is what had gotten her into this mess in the first place as she asked the Goblin King to steal Toby after she found out he had taken one of her stuffed bears. It is thus only by renouncing this love of material goods in favor of loving her brother that she is able to solve the Labyrinth and find her brother. Jones adds a further thematic layer to this by introducing the materialistic temptation via a piece of fruit. Given to her by Hoggle (Shari Weiser/Brian Henson), her friend, the piece of fruit mirrors the apple bitten by Eve that introduces sin to the world. Biting the fruit without hesitation, Sarah is then forced to confront the sin that has held her back from happiness for so long."", ""It is only natural then that the film proceeds to discuss themes regarding selfishness. Derived straight from Sarah's materialistic nature, she is incredibly selfish. She loves her toys for sure, but is annoyed that Toby would dare think that she would share those toys with him. Her parents ask her to babysit and, though she has nothing to do, she resents them and showers them with teenage angst for asking any action from her. As her stepmother says, she gets treated like an evil stepmother (hello Cinderella) despite asking her to babysit being the only demand she makes of her stepdaughter. Not only is she immature, but Sarah is selfish in how she wants to still be treated like a baby and resents Toby for stealing the spotlight from her after having it to herself all these years. Thus, Labyrinth forces her to put her life on the line by making her take the selfless and arduous journey through the Labyrinth to rescue Toby, which forces her to realize how much she loves the kid without the cloud of materialism and selfishness."", ""In line with this, Labyrinth also explores themes of responsibility. Approaching the age at which she will be considered a woman, Sarah must learn a measure of responsibility. When her parents ask her to do something, she needs to know it is not because they hate her, but because they just need some assistance from her. Whether she wants it to be case or not, she must take care of Toby from time to time."" ]";5

Thanks to the comedy here, some actually quite powerful moments, and just pure enjoyment one can derive from this one, 10 Things I Hate About You is a success. However, it is not without its shortcomings. For one, plausibility of many things that happen here is up for debate. Based on what I know about high school, some of the stuff depicted here won't happen. For one, non-spoiler here, but you can't just decide to go to prom the night of, you have to pay well in advance for that stuff. Little things like that add up and really throw the whole thing into question. However, the characters do feel real, from Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles' mysterious, often rumored about characters to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's whiny little loser.

An astute criticism of American culture and also a fantastic shoot em up late 80's action flick, Robocop features solid acting, solid special effects, and a killer plot coupled with great direction and writing. A fun and entertaining film, Robocop works on both a pure entertainment level and the satirical level, similar to Verhoeven's later work on Starship Troopers. In Robocop, Verhoeven uses its relatively straight forward plot as a tool to critique American culture, namely when it comes to violence, television, the military, capitalism, and the very infrastructure of our society. In addition, I also really thought Verhoeven was ahead of his time in his portrayal of women here, as they are shown as being largely on the same playing field as men and if you did not know better, you would have no idea what gender they are. Somehow, this film was criticized for being sexist, but I have no idea how. As I watched, I was struck by how well done the women in the film were, but I guess maybe I am the one who is wrong. Who knows. Anyways, Robocop is a very well made action film by Paul Verhoeven that is both entertaining and thought provoking."" ]";5

Painfully adorable at times, the film has some oddly audacious camera movement from a film of its type, while also being a terrific comedic romp. However, its romantic elements are spotty and wind up being the main weakness of this film from director Roger Michell."", """", ""Comedically, the writing is quintessential Richard Curtis. Sharp and witty, the comedy is not often overt, yet is almost always a winner. The comedy and the delivery from Hugh Grant had me in stitches many a time. This is the type of role where Grant truly shines as an actor, with Notting Hill being a sterling example of his main skillset: charmer with a quick British wit. The comedy here is intensely British from beginning to end, yet it manages to transcend cultural borders with nary a hitch."", """", ""The writing does slack in one area, however: the romance. Shockingly enough for a romantic film, the relationship and romance just did not work as well as expected. Though solid, it was far from expectations. Whilst together, the chemistry between Grant and Roberts is undeniable. The writing reflects this with truly magical sequences of them together that will charm the socks right off your feet with its cuteness. Blended with the aforementioned comedy, Notting Hill was on a good path with these scenes. Yet, its haste it smashing its two lovers together, lack of development of Anna Scott's character, and its resolution all leave a sour taste in your mouth. The end result is that the only conclusion about Anna the viewer can come to is that she is a **** Though Will is head-over-heels with her, we can never understand why. Yes, there is incredible chemistry and passion whilst together. Yet, she keeps dropping the ball and gives very little reason as to why he should try to make it work at all with her. This issue could have been avoided by showcasing her side of things more often and not rushing the romance. Instead, the film slams them together and expects it to work. Whilst it works when they are together, separate the two and things fall apart. The romance lacked justification and its emotion was spotty. By the end, you are convinced they should not be together, in spite of what the film should tell you: that they were meant for each other or some other cheesy reason. I am watching a romantic comedy. Give me cheese. Make me smile because something is so cute. This romance lacks that overall cuteness factor."", """", ""In spite of this, what won me over here is the camera work. Honestly, with the amount of tracking shots, one must wonder if Brian De Palma snuck on set and filmed some scenes in place of Roger Michell. This film loves its tracking shots, especially of Hugh Grant walking through Notting Hill. Another favorite of mine was him and Anna walking at night. This sequence in particular is the most romantic of the entire film and highlights the film's successes both with camera work (not just because of the tracking shot, the shot itself is quite good) and in crafting a romance. The best part of the scene with the duo walking, however, comes in the park. All of a sudden, a medium shot of them reading a park bench dedicated to a couple turns into a truly unique shot that I cannot say I have seen many times before. It is almost as if the camera is strapped to a balloon that was then allowed to float into the air. The end result is a truly striking aerial shot that really takes your breathe away. A final favorite comes with Hugh Grant walking through Notting Hill. Set solely to music, the camera tracks alongside Grant as seasons and time passes seamlessly. I typically hate when a film jumps ahead in time, but Notting Hill executes it so beautifully with a wide array of colors denoting the different seasons, that I have to mark this up sequence as a stroke of genius. Any film that wants to jump ahead in time should be taking notes from this sequence."", """", ""While the film is not as romantic as it could be, tremendous comedic efforts work to overcome the inadequacies of the romance. Plus, a film with this many lovely shots and interesting camera movements cannot be written off too quickly."" ]";5

Many call it heavily inspired by Blair Witch Project, but if it was, it would be devoid of scares and the worst experience of my life. Fortunately, it was not and instead of just being tolerable, it was enthralling. The film does a great job setting up the stakes and creating incredibly interesting human beings who feel so real that, ignoring the camera, feel like people you know. The found footage element only adds to this as it really puts you into the scenes and makes you feel as if you are experiencing these events first hand. Found footage can often be gimmicky, but here, it feels entirely fresh in both its usage and with its story. Together, the end result is a truly captivating and exhilarating thrill ride courtesy of director Matt Reeves."" ]";5

Incredibly fresh even though it is 36 years since it came out, Life of Brian is a fast paced ball of energy that wrings laughs out of nearly every scene in the film, an impressive feat for any comedy film. I have not seen another Monty Python film before, but certainly plan on checking them out, especially after seeing this one.

1632;excalibur;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Now considered to potentially be the best adaptation of the legend of King Arthur, director John Boorman's Excalibur is one of many films to have risen out of the ashes of negative reviews upon release. However, whether it was fully deserving of this critical turnabout is an entirely different matter. As a fantasy adventure film, Excalibur is undeniably a faithful adaptation of the legend and one with excellent operatic sensibilities and great battles. Unfortunately, it is maligned by one deadly disease that strikes at the very heart of the film and can often turn its imaginative fantasy and serious battles into pure, unintentional comedy. This film left me in stitches more often than it ever should have and part of that is due to the dialogue, but the vast majority of it is due to its horrific acting."", ""This horrific acting is pretty much the worst part of this film and what leads to its undoing as a film. In the lead role, we have the horrific Nigel Terry who turns in a confused and oddly tongue-in-cheek performance as King Arthur. Alongside him, Nicol Williamson's Merlin is a clear inspiration for Morgan Freeman's Tiberius in The Lego Movie. He delivers his lines with a odd blend of comedy and serious mysticism with the end result being him appearing to ham it up far too much. The rest of the cast is largely awful for reasons beyond their own control and can be described as Boorman's misstep. Having everybody yell their lines, along with their unconvincing delivery, makes the film and its characters appear wholly unaware of the fact that this is really a Monty Python movie. The actors deliver their lines with no confidence or sense of belief that this is really happening. The worst sinner here is Boorman's daughter Katrine who plays Igrayne, Arthur's mother. As her son is stolen from her by Merlin, her pained screams of \""Get him!\"" are absolutely hysterical with her shrill shrieks being the work of comedy genius. Unfortunately, they were lines intended to be painful, real, and tragic to hear. With horribly unconvincing delivery that makes it seem like the whole cast was just sitting through a table read and going over their lines for the first time when Boorman figured he would just have them read it with the some conviction in the real shoot, Excalibur winds up being unintentional comedy of the highest order."", ""Blended with its fantastical plot, the film's horrible acting is really unfortunate. Instead of a mystical and magical adventure, the film winds up feeling like a funny drug-fueled romp through the minds of a stoner. It is a weird blend of Monty Python and Time Bandits, except played entirely straight to the point that you have no idea whether the film realizes it is so funny. As Lancelot (Nicholas Clay) and Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi) have sex in the forest with Arthur nearing their location and Morgana (Helen Mirren) and Merlin watching on, the scene is entirely comical due to the horrible acting. Mirren and Williamson ham it up as the wizards while the rest of the cast all act horrified, shocked, and ashamed in a way that makes it appear as though this is the first time these actors have ever felt these emotions. The film would be markedly better if its acting were wooden. Instead, it worsens the matter with everybody appearing to be robots or aliens attempting to mimic human behavior."", ""This acting concern is often found in the dialogue, to be fair, as the actors struggle to feel their way through the dialogue that just comes off as far too cheesy to match the film's serious struggle between good and evil. This is even more unfortunate with how well developed the film's themes really are. With Arthur being a Jesus-like figure in this adaptation of the legend, he is tempted and put through the ringer all to prove that he is the true chosen one. Along the way, he offers forgiveness to his wife, his best friend, and seeks to unite his kingdom under a religious center. Honoring his father and family, Arthur is a man that is united by his disciples, fearlessness, and willingness to bring peace and prosperity throughout the land. Including the theme of lust throughout the film that tempts men of every walk of life and serves to be their very undoing, the film may be one of the most soundly written and developed adaptations of Jesus in a non-Jesus film ever put to film. Boorman keeps the film focused upon this theme and always develops it, adding various layers to it that makes it a compelling tale of a man seeking redemption after falling from grace and having to fight his way back through defending his soul from those that want its perfection."" ]";5

What ensues, however, is a film that does not really feel like any other nominee from this era. It is a small scale romantic comedy about a bachelor who comes to find love in a cliched downpour after experiencing four weddings and a funeral over the course of two hours. Frightfully British, Four Weddings and a Funeral is a fine film that, while perhaps not Best Picture good, is a truly funny and charming little film with a typically charismatic Hugh Grant in the lead role opposite Andie Macdowell. The weirdest part of this movie though is the revelation that MacDowell's character has slept with 33 men, whereas Grant's has only slept with nine. Maybe I just think Macdowell looks innocent or something, but there is no way Hugh Grant has slept with less people than her. There are not many people who have slept with more, I would wager. As a side note, I just discovered that Grant had four children between 2011 and 2015. The interesting part is that it was with two women. One, a Chinese woman gave birth in 2011 and 2013. The other, a Swedish woman, gave birth in 2012 and 2015. Having discovered this bit after having written the bit about wagering he slept with more people than most can claim, I now feel even more confident about this bet."", ""That said, focusing on the film, Four Weddings and a Funeral is a truly enjoyable experience. Fast, witty, and smart, the film is not merely some disposable comedy. Instead, it goes to great lengths to subtly develop its characters. By focusing on the weddings and the funeral, the character development can slide by undetected. But, it is absolutely there and quite abundant. Through these encounters, the film explores friendship and mortality. With each passing wedding, these single characters feel time ticking, but find joy in their group of friends. The shared experience and bond with one another is readily apparent and worn on their sleeves throughout, particularly when one of the group gets married. Offering their congratulations, but equally expressing their hope that they will stay in touch, you feel the hopelessness of that request. Through no fault of their own, marriage will cause strain on friendships. People you loved will fall to the side purely because of time limits or distance. It is like every major moment in your life - graduating high school, graduating college, moving, getting a job, getting married, etc - where things change and people move on to new things. In the process, people close to you are left behind. Thus, the film becomes quite somber as you recognize that the love felt in the romance is simultaneously the happy couple spending their last hurrah with their old group of friends, some of whom they will never share the same connection with again."", ""Romantically, the film does not click nearly as well. It is a film that focuses on missed connections through unrequited love or the one you love marrying someone else. Yet, it lacks the guts to subvert expectations. Instead, it relies upon a cheesy sequence in the rain that is lazily written and oddly acted by Grant and Macdowell to close out this film. While undeniably cute, it does not jive well with the rest of the film and instead feels too neat to truly work for this film. While I am hardly arguing that the film is transcendent or not cliche up to that point, it does feel a little odd for a film to end so happy when it portrays every other issue that pops up as merely something we must deal with in life. There is no perfect person, deaths happen, unrequited love is real, and missed connections happen due to circumstance. Sadly, it lacks the courage to punch the audience in the gut by having Charles (Hugh Grant) just marry the girl he does not love because it is what he feels he must do, regardless of love. Sadly, it is a largely safe and entirely palatable romantic comedy, so expectations are not subverted here."", ""Charming and witty with tremendous comedic dialogue, Four Weddings and a Funeral feels like a comedy drama tricked into playing up to romantic comedy expectations, even if its first two acts seem to be leading up to an entirely different film. That said, it is a fun film and a pretty odd Best Picture nominee. Featuring a slickly charismatic turn from Hugh Grant in the lead role alongside a game supporting cast, the film is terrific for laughs and an equally great look at friendship as one ages and begins going to weddings and funerals on a regular basis. While gooey and cheesy, it is undeniably great fun to watch unfold."" ]";5
1634;breakfast-at-tiffanys;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""I confess that my recent viewing of William Wyler's heist comedy How to Steal a Million was the first time I had seen Audrey Hepburn in a starring role. Before that, just her bit cameo in Steven Spielberg's Always had crossed my path and that came just mere weeks before the other occasion. In essence, I am just beginning in my understanding of Hepburn as an actress and perhaps no film captures everything she was in her roles than Breakfast at Tiffany's. Yet, before I get into reviewing it, I feel the need to share. Perhaps I am a bit grim in my own personal life. Death and its inevitability is, naturally, a mainstay in my mind. This has very little to do with Breakfast at Tiffany's on the surface, though I will later try to tie it back in out of my simple need to keep on task in these reviews. For me, death was always something to be feared, though it was focused inward. My own demise, as a young child, kept me up at nights. I can remember lying in bed, paralyzed by the thought that one day, I will die. This, as it often does, turned itself into two things. One, the burning desire to be remembered. When I was younger, the mark of being remembered is to somehow have a Wikipedia page. That way, in 100 years, some stupid kid can hit \""random page\"" and my page will pop up and they will read about how banal my life actually turned out to be. While this may be a bit simplistic, it is the truth nonetheless. Second, fear of death of those I love. Whether it be my mother or my dog, the inevitability of their deaths and my resultant mourning often leaves me on the brink of tears. With my dog, now 15, having an infection under the skin around his salivary glands and being forced into a cone of shame as we wait for the swelling to go down, the light is most certainly appearing at the end of the tunnel. Perhaps not soon, as otherwise, he is incredibly healthy for a dog his age with little-to-no gray hair and enough energy to outpace many young pups. My mother, likewise, has been quite healthy aside from aches and pains. Both are a blessing and will be missed with all of my heart."", ""However, both have allowed me to realize something bigger. Just as Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain showed me that death is not to be feared, but to be embraced. The mortality of those that I love has shown me that my desire to be remembered does not need to wind up in something juvenile or asinine such as a Wikipedia. To be truly remembered is to remain in the hearts and minds of those that you love. Beyond those that you love, nobody else really matters and whether or not they are aware of your existence is simply not important. As for becoming remembered or finding those that you love, you can merely go about your day-to-day life and live it as you wish. Doing as you wish rather than what others think is right for you or expect you to do is the only way to secure happiness, which is always the key to unlocking the doors awaiting ahead."", ""Now, what does this have to do with Hepburn and Breakfast at Tiffany's? I am getting to that shortly. But, as many  know, Hepburn died of cancer in 1993. In order for her to spend a final Christmas with family, Givenchy flew her out on a private plane - which was filled with flowers - to Switzerland. For some reason, this gesture - though I had read about it before - really struck a chord with me tonight. For Hepburn, she is clearly an idol. Women today still adore her and I have known female friends who have gone as her for Halloween with a black dress and gloves, akin to her famous outfit in this film. Yet, though an icon for women's fashion to this very day and a figure that will last on in Hollywood until the end of time, her final weeks and days were spent with those that she loved. Those that were dear to her gathered around and did anything they could to bring her a last little bit of joy as they spent time together to say goodbye. No matter how loved we are, at the end, only those we love really matter and should matter once we are gone. As long as we remain in their hearts and minds, it was a life worth living."", ""In her most famous role as Holly Golightly, Hepburn defines her persona as people will see her for as long as she is remembered. From her iconic dresses, cigarette holder, or hairstyle, every inch of her performance has been turned into a style or fashion icon. Bubbly and boisterous, Holly is like many girls I have known. Though they may appear dumb and shallow on the outside for their love of jewels, fancy dresses, or appearances, there is no doubt something on the inside. The rest is merely a facade to hide up something on the inside that hurts them or they do not like. Hepburn's Holly really captures this inner damage as she rejects men she cares for in order to go after rich men who she does not care about. To tie it in to the earlier discussion about death, she was afraid of losing people. To love is to let people in and to open yourself up to emotional turmoil when they leave."" ]";5

While definitely sentimental and the most quintessential display of it in a Spielberg film, the film finds great tension when in the air and great charm while on the ground. That said, it is quite predictable and clearly manipulative, even if it is a compelling look at death."", ""Dying and being tasked with inspiring Ted Baker (Brad Johnson) to become an aerial firefighter, Pete (Richard Dreyfuss) is not ready to go.

He is not ready to give up his life with Dorinda (Holly Hunter). It may be time to go, but he wants to keep Dorinda as his own and not share her with Ted, who is quickly moving in on Pete's territory. Able to speak and direct people to do something, nobody can see Pete and write it off as a voice in their head or their own mind telling them to do something. Thus, he goes undetected by everybody but Hap. Eventually, he learns he must say goodbye to let Dorinda move on from his death and not want her own demise as a result. The only way she will be happy and live the rest of her life with Ted is if Pete says goodbye. Tearjerking and melodramatic, the film's portrayal of death - though odd - is well done and well thought out for the most part and the film is quite effective at moving the audience with this portrayal. It is a film that would likely be of great comfort to somebody who just lost a loved one for its portrayal of the need to say goodbye."", ""Yet, the best sequences have to be in the air. High flying daredevils, these aerial firefighters are insane people. Al (John Goodman), Pete, Dorinda, and Ted, are all shown flying and they all risk their lives in the process. These scenes are excellently staged and captured by Spielberg with each sequence being filled with tension and capture the fear and adrenaline of situation to perfection. Compared to the situation on the ground, the situation in the air is incredibly reminiscent to Top Gun and captures that same free flying spirit. On the ground, it is far more solemn than Top Gun, but in the air, the two are very similar in how they capitalize on the natural tension of flying and fighting fire with fire."", ""That said, Always is hardly memorable. While playing with similar emotions as many other Spielberg films - tension and tears - it just lacks the gravitas to make it all come together. It may be Spielberg at the helm, but even his lesser films feel more like Spielberg than just in the themes. This one could have been done by anybody and feels like a director-for-hire film. While he gets great performances out of Dreyfuss and Hunter, this is absolutely Spielberg on autopilot and just doing a film to get the studio behind him, even though they clearly are and should be behind him for the future. Thus, I have no idea why he would make it. Mind you, it is hardly an awful film, but it just not particularly special or memorable. It comes, it entertains, and then it goes without even waving or having the courtesy to say goodbye. It just ends and you find yourself sitting and looking at the screen and saying, \""Well, that was pleasant.\"" Five minutes later, you sit down to write a review about on Letterboxd and think, \""Boy that John Goodman was funny. Good acting. But what happened again exactly?\"" While not complicated, it is not a film that will stick in your mind and that is its biggest fault and usually something Spielberg brings to the table."", ""Tame, tolerable, and largely quite enjoyable, Always has some good fantasy elements, solid tension, and a nice romance, but Audrey Hepburn deserved a better film for her final role."" ]";5

It is loaded with twists and overacting, while also being dragged down by a bad ending with bad visuals. That said, Deathtrap is some easy fun throughout with Caine and Reeve having good chemistry together as the humor and mystery get terrifyingly meta.

A complicated film from there on out, Deathtrap has a lot of moving parts, not unlike the rubiks cube in the poster. It is a complicated film at times with how fast the plot moves, but have no fear because the characters will invariably explain the plot to you in an attempt at meta humor. This meta humor rarely works as effectively as it should with the mystery being the main draw. How will it all end up? Who will end up victorious, even if they have blood on their hands? It is in the mystery that director Sidney Lumet's film finds success, as the film's mystery is compelling put together and really grips the viewer from the very beginning. The ending is a mystery and one that never tips its hand throughout the film, leaving the audience entirely in the dark as  to what will occur. Plus, tongue-in-cheek references to how well past scenes worked for misleading the audience are somewhat funny and greatly appreciated."", ""However, Deathtrap's mystery is not perfect. The ending is pretty bad. The suspense and mystery lacks a great pay-off that is too nonsensical and comical to actually fit in tonally with the rest of the film. For such a well thought out plot, it sort of gives up at the end. Worse, the strobe lights are blinding. Set during a lightning storm, the power goes out leaving the characters to scramble around in the dark, only brightened by the lightning outside. This is overkill and left me fighting a headache and having to look away from the screen. It hurts and would probably cause a lot of issues for somebody with epilepsy. As such, this ending is not even visually appealing as it goes too overboard and gets so wrapped up in being meta, it forgets to actually tell a story beyond the story."", ""Deathtrap also suffers from the acting. Dyan Cannon is very bad in this film. She exclusively screams and screeches, making any scene without her pure bliss. She is horrific, but sadly, her co-stars are not great either. Michael Caine, typically a great actor, simply mishandles this one with an over-the-top performance. Christopher Reeve, not a great actor, rides his toned abs and torso to an average performance. Impressively, he does this all while looking like a male model from a men's winter fashion magazine. Unfortunately, he is the best this film has to offer in terms of acting, which may be an indicator as to one of Deathtrap's greatest weaknesses."", ""Ultimately, Deathtrap is a fun ride. It is enjoyably mysterious and meta at times, but it can become grating with the latter at times when it oversells that element. However, a bad ending and bad acting hold the film back and leave it as nothing more than enjoyable, yet forgettable, fun. Fortunately, it just so happens to be a lot of fun to experience and watch unfold."" ]";5

A film about the Holocaust, the film shows how one man's energy and passion for life can shield his young son from the atrocities surrounding him. The film toes the line between tragedy, comedy, and romance, throughout, but knocks all of them out of the park. It is heart warmingly funny and Roberto Benigni has an absolutely irresistible charm that almost distracts the viewer from the horror they are watching. The romantic element is touching and brilliantly executed (it also has the best non-sex sex scene, I've seen). Finally, the tragedy is hard-hitting. This film will truly break your heart and those last 20 minutes are guaranteed to at least leave you on the brink of tears. As a whole, Life Is Beautiful is a wonderful film that differs from other Holocaust films in that it brings some a different human element to the table, other than despair.

After laboring through the other films by Terrence Malick and seeing the potential for a great film if he could ever figure out how to write a damn film, this one brings it all together. Featuring his trademark brilliant cinematography, The Thin Red Line is brilliantly written and beautifully acted turning this one into one of the best war films ever released and one of the strongest films of the 1990s. A character driven film, The Thin Red Line relies upon love, brotherhood, and other true human feelings and emotions rather than blood and carnage to tell the tale of its many characters. The script is beautifully poetic with so many moving lines they are impossible to count. The cast is huge and features many past and current stars in great turns, such as Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn, Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte, Dash Mihok, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto, John Travolta, George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, Larry Romano, and many, many more. This is one of the best examples of a film in which every seen features somebody you know and have seen in many different films and it really puts them together for a phenomenal cast. The score to the film is also beautiful and is the last touch to what is really one of the most poetic and brilliant war films ever. Though it gets lost in the shuffle of 1998 due to the release of Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line is fantastic in its own right."" ]";5

She does all of these while being the middle child upstaged by her bratty and selfish younger sister and bullied by her older brother. Her life is not easy and she is ill-equipped to handle it, being as she is incredibly awkward and timid. The ensuing film is cringy and relies upon this black comedy awkward humor that really only accentuates the awkward nature of our lead character. Yet, in doing so, director Todd Solondz creates an incredibly relatable and sympathetic character that exists in a film so real, so authentic, and so intimate, it is hard to look away."", ""The crowning achievement of this film is the writing. I have only seen one Solondz before this - Storytelling - but it is clear that he has an impetus to write awkward characters who say awkward things. Yet, these awkward things are real. As Dawn fumbles around after high school boy Steve Rodgers (Eric Mabius), it feels authentic. These are real people experiencing real issues with growing up. Dawn really emphasizes this when betraying her younger sister, rebuking her mother, or running off. She is unhappy in this world and in her suburban lifestyle where she is overlooked by her parents and rejected by her siblings. At school, she is mocked with her locker being vandalized on the front and her being constantly called **** or \""wiener dog\"" (also the title of Solondz's 2016 feature...).

The family is falling apart at the seems. Dawn hates this family, yet she is going to fight for it all the same. Trudging out on her own to find Missy, the 12-year old Dawn goes throughout the city hanging posters and sleeps outside for a night. Yet, by the time she calls home, Missy is found and her mother is too distracted granting interviews to talk to Dawn on the phone. One of her daughters is missing, but Dawn's mother could care less and is more focused on Missy and satisfying her own ego. By night time, they all watch the news to see Missy's interview. This sequence is incredibly tragic and really defines Dawn's character as being one that is forgotten."", ""Of course, she is hardly alone. In her time in middle school, she befriends Brandon (Brendan Sexton III), a troubled boy with a horrible home life. Living in a dilapidated home with a down syndrome brother and neglectful brother, Brandon has a tough life. Yes, he threatens to rape Dawn, but it is likely a misunderstanding of the word or the concept, as by the end of the film, he has shown himself to be just as tragic as Dawn. Overlooked and just written off as a failure by adults and fellow students, Brandon has a good heart somewhere, just buried under a thick emotional shield. When he opens up - offering a girl named Cookie a cookie as a birthday gift - he is rebuffed and his \""cheap\"" gift is tossed aside. Brandon is very much like Dawn, just leading a less privileged lifestyle. Rejected and an outcast, the two find solace in one another, but it is never meant to last."", ""A melancholy black comedy film about adolescence, Welcome to the Dollhouse is an incredibly authentic and moving film that never mocks its characters.

Starring Billy Crystal as Ben Sobel, a psychiatrist, the film pairs him together with Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro). A tough, hard-nosed, and old school gangster, he is having panic attacks stemming from a threat to his life that brings back memories of his father's murder. In a funny and witty comedy, the film pairs the comedic talents of Crystal with the tough guy nature of De Niro resulting in a perfect setup of comedic foils. Thanks to fun writing from Harold Ramis and Kenneth Lonergan, the film may not be serious, but it makes the most of its premise and really works well. It may be thin and referential to gangster movies, but the film entertains and makes you laugh for the entire runtime."", ""With irresistible chemistry, Crystal plays the man entrusted to break through the tough guy facade of Paul Vitti. Unfortunately, it comes at the time when he is set to be married to Laura (Lisa Kudrow) in Florida. With Paul following him from New York, he is forced to try and work his magic to figure out what ails this man. Suffering from panic attacks and fits of crying, Vitti is risking being killed due to this weakness. He can hear the footsteps and keeps sending his friend Jelly (Joe Vierelli) to go find the doc, regardless of what stage of getting married he finds himself in. Even worse, gangster Primo Sindone (Chazz Palminteri) wants Paul dead and the mafia, once they find out about the psychiatrist, want Ben dead. What ensues is a pretty predictable and run-of-the-mill comedy that finds humor out of making a gangster soft and a psychiatrist into a gun toting tough guy. Yet, it works."", ""Crystal and De Niro's chemistry is what sells this one as Crystal smart, witty, and mouthy comedic style really works in this film. De Niro is equally good in his role as a remorseful gangster that does not want to leave his son without a father or see him follow a life as a gangster. Yet, the film does exist on a higher plain to a degree as it examines and breaks down the tough guy facade. In reality, it is merely a copping mechanism to shelter their fragile psyches from being hurt. Or, they are just psycho. The latter obviously being far more dangerous. In the case of Paul Vitti, he just acts out of anger and desperation after being left to fend for himself after his father is killed. Thus, though the film is simply straight forward fun, Ramis and Lonergan manage to make the film have a little more depth in this area. In this blending of their two worlds, the two men are able to learn from one another. Ben Sobel learns to stand up for himself and not take abuse. Paul Vitti learns that being emotional and expressing your feelings does not make you weak. For a silly comedy that is just a twist on the buddy comedy formula, it does provide very well-written characters with solid, well-defined arcs and with purposeful actions in this film."", ""Honestly, however, there is not much to say about this one. Even what I have written is a bit of a stretch. Bottom line: Analyze This is hysterical. Billy Crystal is Billy Crystal and De Niro turns in one of his funnier performances of his late comedy-focused period.

1646;witness;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Witness is an incredibly methodical and thoughtful film by director Peter Weir. Described as a crime thriller, it may be more accurately described as a drama. Arriving in an Amish town after a young boy witnesses a murder in Philadelphia, Detective John Book (Harrison Ford) is forced to hide out with the boy's family to avoid detection from the dirty cops he has uncovered with the boy's help. Along the way, this big city cop with secular ways of doing so strikes up a romance with Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis), an Amish girl with limited exposure to the outside world. Though Peter Weir's film is often incredibly understated and its crime element is compelling, its musings on the difference between city life and the Amish is obvious and its ending is a bit too blunt."", ""First, the good. The romance between John and Rachel is subdued, restrained, and powerful. Of all the moments in this film, the simple looks between the two as the stare at one another is incredible. Weir gives us the climactic kiss, but even then, he refuses to let the lovers lose sight of reality. Instead of just having them move mountains to be together, the two are forced to face facts and realize things could never work. John is a hardened big city cop who has been raised in the world. Rachel is a woman who is Amish, she keeps the house, and she makes lemonade. That is her day. She was raised in relative seclusion in a very plain society. The two are simply too different for love to every really blossom or be prosperous between the two of them. Weir's films are often elusive to me in the pay-off, but here, this portion is so tremendously written that its subdued and grounded nature is endearing, painful, and real."", ""The film also benefits from great characters. John Book and Rachel Lapp makes for great and realistic lovers. But, aside from that, their characters are well developed. Book, introduced as a hard nosed city cop, is also quite gentle and caring. He is hardened to the world and carries a gun, but merely wants justice and has a clear moral compass. He is not a man that will stray from the path of justice for quick pay-offs. Rather, he will bide his time, gather evidence, and is open to believing the truth. This is underscored when young Samuel Lapp (Lukas Haas) identifies the man he saw as a killer. He accepts this and pursues it, in spite of the heat it will bring on him. For this, he is an incredibly brave man. On the flip side, Rachel is a woman that has walked with God all her life. Her husband recently died and she is Samuel's mother. She does what is expected of her and nothing more. She may be restrained and restricted, but shows that she can be a passionate person, if only her society allowed for her to be one. Unfortunately, her whole life is there and it is not something she wants to lose. This sense of being trapped by circumstances is a painful one to watch unfold, but Weir's ability to step out of focus and give to his two absolutely brilliant stars is admirable and lends the film serious gravitas."", ""Unfortunately, the ending does betray this somewhat. Though a reserved film, its ending is far too elaborate. It has complex choreography and set pieces as the guilty parties close in on John Book and look to silence him. It is more akin to a thriller in these sequences, which is what it is billed as, but it feels as though it betrays the essence of the first and second act. A slow, beautiful look at a man and woman from different worlds gives way to a suspenseful third act. This unfortunate diversion detracts from the overall film, but is also oddly inconclusive in the communication of its meaning. As with all \""fish out of water\"" type films, the two sides learn from one another. John learns community, hard work, and humility. Rachel and the Amish learn about passion, know-how, and strength. It is underscored in the final sequence where John does kill the main villain. He merely takes his gun away and leaves him for the cops. In an earlier conversation, an elder explains to young Samuel that the Amish are not to kill and that guns are only meant for those who wish to kill. It is not a person's place to judge who must die and who is good or bad. We are simply ill-equipped to judge a person on those qualities. As such, John - demonstrating that he has learned - does not kill the man. Instead, the man loses out to John and the dozens of Amish men who have shown up to assist the Lapp family in their time of need. This scene is powerful and shows the strength of this community and its familial bonds. It is a sense of community and togetherness not seen in the big city. Yet, it stands juxtaposed to the scene immediately prior where John kills two other would be attackers. It may be in self-defense, but the elder Amish men made it quite clear that killing is not good regardless of whether or not it was in self-defense or to \""preserve the good\"". So, did John learn or did he not? The film's ending is inconclusive."" ]";5

Blending social commentary with neurosis, Mighty Aphrodite is a play on the Greek tragedies and amended for Allen's style and wit. The end result is a film that references various Greek tragedies throughout and manages to subvert the expectations of its genre, in spite of repeated warnings from the chorus. Inventive, imaginative, quirky, and witty, Mighty Aphrodite is a film that is decidedly Woody Allen, but feels risky and far more adventurous than many of his other more modern films. With a classic turn from the oddball filmmaker and from Mira Sorvino, Mighty Aphrodite is an incredibly charming film."", ""The best part of this film is undoubtedly the chorus. Led by F. Murray Abraham, the chorus is a source of great comedy from interactions with Lenny Weinrib (Woody Allen) to calling Zeus and getting his answering machine, the chorus is hysterical. However, as with all Greek tragedies, they play a key role. They tell of events off-screen, alert us to issues the characters face, and intervene throughout. F. Murray Abraham pops up throughout the film to urge Lenny to not be an idiot or give him advice on how to handle a situation. But, above all, the chorus is there is warn characters about obsession and the path to avoid tragedy. They are incredibly doom and gloom and constantly expect the worst to come around every corner. However, Allen's film subverts this with a largely happy and sound landing. Things work out the way they are should with no miscommunication or other romantic comedy cliches. Instead, Allen takes the depressing endings of Greek tragedies and plays it more along the lines of a rom-com where everybody ends up satisfied. This feels like subversion, if only because of the chorus and Allen's repeated references to Greek plays."", ""One of the most prominent plays referenced in the film is Oedipus. With Jocasta (Olympia Dukakis) and Laius (David Ogden Stiers) in the film, Allen makes overt references, but also adds in Kevin (Michael Rapaport). On a date with with porn star and prostitute Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino), Kevin makes repeated references to how he wants a girl like his mother who takes care of the home and makes dinner, etc. Clearly Oedipal, this date is a precursor to the poor guy finding out Linda made porn films. Needless to say, he did not take kindly. The references continue with a fortune teller named Cassandra (Danielle Ferland) who nobody takes seriously as she warns Lenny about tracking down Linda, the mother of his adopted son, and - along with the chorus - warns him about the trap of obsession. Lenny ignores these warnings and goes behind his wife Amanda's (Helena Bonham Carter) back to find Linda to satisfy his own curiosity (the real killer of people, not that **** about the ozone layer\"", as the chorus warns) regarding his brilliant son's roots. The film also introduces Tiresias (Jack Warden), the blind prophet. Warning Lenny as to his wife's potential unfaithfulness, Tiresias sees all and remarks that one would \""have to be blind\"" to not see Amanda's positive response to her potential lover. Oh the dramatic irony."", ""Allen treks on with an ending fit for a Greek tragedy, even if it is not tragic and more in line with a romantic comedy. With Lenny having Linda's son and Linda giving birth to a daughter fathered by Lenny, the two meet again once more a few years after the events of the film. However, they both keep the lineage of their children a secret. They are pleased to see one another with both of them happily married to other people. A classic case of dramatic irony with the audience knowing the truth, but both characters ignorant of the truth, the film's ending is honestly perfect."", ""That said, the film does have some faults. After a hot start with a fast and light opening 20 minutes that leaves you in stitches, the next 40-50 minutes are a bit slower. The humor is more subtle as Allen dives into the plot with Linda. Jokes come, but not like the first 20 minutes, which was constant. Instead, some jokes fall a bit flatter or result in simple chuckles. This section is what separates it from Allen's best works, as the final half hour or so is terrific yet again. However, the second act just slacks a bit and fails to live up to great first and third acts of this film."", ""However, Mighty Aphrodite is still an incredibly funny film that is easy entertainment. With a neurotic and nervy turn from Woody Allen and a great bombastic performance from Mira Sorvino, the film is fun and light entertainment. Allen's films manages to always be a breeze to watch, but always truly mentally engaging at the same time with some philosophical thoughts. But, he instead dumps the philosophy here and goes to the source: Greek tragedies. Allen has a thing for the mind of the Greeks and that becomes all the more clear in this film."" ]";5

An imaginative tale that blurs the line between dreams and reality, the film is incredibly engaging and entertaining throughout with phenomenal performances from the entire cast. As with the previous two films, the film is more of an ode to storytelling as an escape from reality, more than a straight film that can be defined between dreams and the real world. A film about the mysterious Baron Munchausen (John Neville) and his band of odd helpers (Eric Idle, Charles McKeown, Winston Dennis, and Jack Purvis), the Baron crashes a performance of his life story and informs the audience and actors that they are true stories. Though extraordinary, his adventures are not mere legend and, even more, he is the reason why the Turkish sultan is bombing their beloved city because he stole the sultan's treasure. What ensues is a film that is magical and fantastical that reaches comedic and adventure heights like only Gilliam can reach."", ""In the first entry in this trilogy, Time Bandits, Gilliam focused on a child. Living in unhappy home with parents who are more concerned with their material goods than their own son, the boy goes to sleep one night and a small band of thieves pop up in his room. What ensues is an imaginative experience that, though it sets it up as occurring in a dream world, drops a few hints that maybe everything was real. In Brazil, the second installment, Gilliam created a 1984-esque dystopian world that is incredibly real, except for the middle aged protagonist's frequent dreams about a different world, culminating in a dream world breakout from prison that is shown to be anything but real. This film, picking up from there, has the Baron tell his story to the crowd as he simultaneously saves the city from the sultan in a dream world. Only it appears to be a dream world, as by the end, the sultan is gone and the city has been saved. Yet, while all of these films show the stories escaping the dream world and jumping into reality, the line between the two hardly matters."", ""Rather, Gilliam's tales are about the necessity of storytelling and imagination. Objectively, regardless of what the endings show, we all know that dreams are not real. They may reflect reality - as shown in the films by characters in the dreams sharing resemblances with real people, such as Uma Thurman's dual role as city girl Rose and, in the dream, the goddess Venus - but they are simply not real. Gilliam's films, however, suspend this disbelief via storytelling and/or imagination. He fashions his films as an escape from a horrific reality - neglectful parents, dystopian world, a city under siege - with the stories and collective imaginations of the characters being a blissful departure from their traumatic real lives. Thus, the film's finales do not hint at them being real or having actually occurred. Instead, it depicts that it hardly matters. The dream world is objectively better, even if it is not real, than the lives these people lead. Collectively, everybody in these films opt for these falsehoods to enter a state of bliss. In Brazil, the protagonist is declared insane for this, but regardless of his sanity, he has escaped his prison. The boy in Time Bandits escapes in the end via his dreams and the town is saved in this film because they opted to ignore reality and instead enter the world of their imaginations, in which the city is still standing and safe from the sultan."", ""In crafting this world of imagination, Gilliam continuously finds new antics and ideas to introduce. For instance, the moon brings some of the film's comedic heights with a terrific supporting appearance from Robin Williams as The King of the Moon. A floating head trying to escape the carnal tyranny of his body, the King is a higher being who can create Spring by whistling. His wife Queen Ariadne (Valentina Cortese) is similarly able to separate her head from her body and reach a higher state of being. The two not only exist as a statement on the possibilities of the mind without physical limitations, but are also hysterical entries into the film. No matter where the Baron and his child helper Sally Salt (Sarah Polley) wind up, Gilliam's film is imbued with a sense of adventure that capitalizes on the film's naturally whimsical state of being."", ""An uproariously funny and thoroughly engaging film, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is a film with a lot of moving parts and demonstrates Gilliam's tremendous ability to create fun and smart films for audiences of all ages. Not limited by the PG-rating, the film explores important themes such as honesty, while creating a tale about embracing the oddities of life. No matter where you wind up, there is a way out of it (even death) if you are willing to take chances and embrace possibilities that were previously inconceivable.

Somehow, Nora Ephron captured this brilliantly with both characters being terrific in displaying the anxiety and, of course, Joe's reaction with his friend Kevin (Dave Chappelle) to seeing Kathleen waiting for him."", ""Interestingly, the film is also a compelling look at business. Book store rivals, Joe Fox is heir to the throne of a large company. Kathleen is heir to the wooden chair of a small storefront. The two are combative in business, hence why their meeting was so truly awkward and unlikely. Ephron plays on that angle a bit too much in the romance, hence the lying. But, in its portrayal of a big business steam rolling a small one, it shows both sides incredibly well. Yes, it is tragic to lose that small store that was always on the street and connected with the local people. However, the big store is not all bad. The employees may be less knowledgeable and management more disconnected, but it has larger reach and is more affordable. For books, this is a great thing as it allows reading to reach more people and the extra amenities in the store do foster community and establish the store as one that people would like to be in with a good book in front of them. Yet, it attracts incredibly negative attention for derailing popular local stores, even though they too provide a valuable service."", ""Impeccably cute, but a little grating at times, You've Got Mail is simply an excuse to watch Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan hang out for two hours.

Instead, Bonnie and Clyde ushered in New Hollywood, an auteur driven era that found American directors reveling in the lifting of the Hays code and lifting all censors from their work. However, American audiences still had to shed their own conceptions as to what can and cannot be allowed in a work of art and it was Bonnie and Clyde that started to make critics and audiences alike realize the potential of this new era. Opening up with Faye Dunaway nude with her back to the camera, it was clear that cinema was about to become far friskier. Rushing to the window without clothes on after hearing the mysterious Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) poking around with her mother's car, Dunaway's Bonnie Parker soon takes up with Clyde with Dunaway turning the iconic crime spree girl into a real sexpot. From trying to help Clyde with his impotence to stroking his gun and looking seductively into his eyes, Bonnie Parker practically single-handedly lifts America into this new era with her sultry disposition and raw sexuality."", ""Criticized for celebrating these two murderers, the film actually does anything but when you really look at it all. Bonnie and Clyde are the protagonists, yes, but the film shows their insanity, their hubris, their stupidity, and their greed. Always confident they will never be caught, they take chances and mock those that chase them. They take photos with the police and meet up with random people from whom they had stolen a car. These are two dumb kids who, while maybe not wholly evil, are malevolently moronic. Any average criminal would get caught, but the duo were the benefits of their free wheeling attitude and willingness to drive across the whole of America in committing their crimes. Turning them into myths, the two would show up randomly into a town and rob a bank while the newspaper would attribute them with three times as many robberies in places they had never been. They were ghosts and the go-to for any news story. Had they not driven all over and the media not started printing falsehoods, it is entirely possible they would have been able to be tracked by the police. Instead, it was a wild goose chase until they were able to turn CW Moss (Michael J. Pollard) against the couple."", ""Unafraid to show the graphic results of the couple's violence, we see them kill innocents and kill cops right up close. We see them take on the cops and, yet, we root for them. Through all of their stupidity and murderous intent, the couple are classic cinematic antiheroes who make you root for them out of respect for their pure brazenness and utter lack of inhibition. The film's portrayal of violence, however, breaks through this a bit. From when they kill innocents to when they are finally executed in a hail of bullets, we see what this life of crime brings: violence and a lot of it. Director Arthur Penn uses this violence, alongside the sexuality, to usher in that new era of Hollywood, but to also jar the audience. The violence is unexpected from a film released in 1967. For it to be so bloody and so graphic, audiences at the time had to be running for the hills. I mean, we see a guy get shot five inches from the camera. We see a woman lose her eye. This is a brutal, brutal film. Penn does this shocking level of violence to underscore that Bonnie and Clyde are not to be revered. Their hands are covered in blood and their hubris has caused many good people to die and leave their families behind. While the papers and their legacy has romanticized their status to an insane degree, the gritty details are simple: they are murderers. Bonnie and Clyde is a film that is unafraid to confront this reality, no matter how much it may shock."", ""A boundary smashing film, Arthur Penn's rendition of the classic crime couple Bonnie and Clyde finds Penn introducing overt sexuality, sensuality, and violence to American films in telling this classic story. Not romanticizing it in the least, Penn offers up gruesome recountings of the couple's crime spree across America and shows their immaturity and pride, which ultimately led to their demise in a hail of bullets. Finding Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway doing some of their best work as the classic couple alongside a charismatic and scenery chewing Gene Hackman, Bonnie and Clyde ushered in a new era in film while decisively closing the book on the more romantic beliefs some had regarding Bonnie and Clyde. There is no romance in violence, underscored by Clyde's impotence and the film's refusal to show them as anything but remorseless idiots that stole from others simply because they could, while being unafraid to shoot their way out of a tight spot."" ]";5

From the very beginning, the film has a weird tone to it that continues throughout (I saw somebody compare the beginning to a comedy like Monty Python and they're not wrong). Cate Blanchett is phenomenal, as are Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston, Richard Attenborough, and Joseph Fiennes. The structure reminds me oddly of The Godfather and pieces of it bear some resemblance in how it was portrayed, which was unexpected. Additionally, though slow, it feels like it needed to be longer. At two hours, it felt like some things got left out and others were rushed, which hurt the overall film. That being said, the acting really saves this one and it is as strikingly gorgeous production/costume design wise as a period piece should be. Overall, Elizabeth is an above average biopic of Queen Elizabeth I."" ]";5
1655;true-lies;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Cheesy, stupid, and bombastic, in all of the right ways, James Cameron's True Lies is a quintessential American action from the 1980s/1990s. Loaded to the point of bursting with one-liners, cleavage, and explosions, True Lies is the type of macho insanity that keeps men lining up to watch action films to this very day. Yet, action films of today lack the same whimsical sense of stupid brilliance that films such as True Lies captured so effortlessly. Somewhere in the one-line dropping courtesy of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cameron turns True Lies into a ballet of testosterone, sexism, and penis envy, that only he can make come off so effortlessly excellent. Without the cruel restraints of telling a serious story found in Cameron's prior action work, he is allowed to fully indulge in explosions and carnage in a way that Michael Bay only wishes he could. Honestly, if Bay did not watch this film and walk home crying, I would be stunned."", ""As an action comedy film, True Lies never takes itself too seriously. Indulging in over-the-top explosions, rescue missions, and absurd plot turns, Cameron lets the audience know from the jump that this is really just male fantasy in film form. Dropping in Arnold Schwarzenegger as the audience surrogate, allowing men in the crowd to feel one with his overtly masculine appearance, we experience his world vicariously through him. Cool, calm, married to Jamie Lee Curtis, and spitting game with Tia Carrere, Arnold's secret agent Harry Tasker is what every man would openly admit to wanting to be. Toss in a few \""cool guys don't look at explosions\"" moments to open this film and this becomes a proverbial wet dream for macho men everywhere or wimpy men who wish to be macho. Just watch his cool under the pressure demeanor, casual one-liners as he beats the pulp out of a man just as buff as himself (\""here cool off\""), and rushes to save his wife and daughter from the grasp of international terrorists, and try to deny that every man does not want to be Harry. He saves the day. Looks good doing it and gets every girl around. There is an obvious appeal and Cameron plays it to cartoony perfection, ditching reality in the name of just embracing the cheese. It is a stupid film to be sure, but scenarios where we all dream of being a hero under pressure are undoubtedly just as stupid so it is only natural the film would be the same way."", ""Yet, equally as obvious is how the film would line up with the theories of Yvonne Tasker regarding masculinity in these macho, testosterone-filled films. Torturing the male form from beginning to end, True Lies is loaded with explosions and pain for Arnold. With Harry Tasker getting beat up brutally at every turn, having his clothes ripped, and having to lift himself up off of the brink of certain death, he is a man who seems to have a very low life expectancy. While he may not bleed as much as some of his opponents, this is not an easy mission for him and is one that leads to him having to change his ripped shirts for a different one quite often. With the rips and the action, however, the male physique is constantly turned into spectacle here and the reason why any tickets were sold. In the most intimate action set piece - the bathroom scene - there are no explosions but lots of gunfire and fighting. Pitting Harry Tasker with a man just as big as himself, this spectacle of two men in peak physical condition is undeniable and brought to the forefront."", ""However, the film certainly tortures the men a bit in a different way. Men define themselves by the women they get and their ability to please them, hence male insecurity regarding their privates and jealousy. With Helen Tasker (Curtis) beginning to stray due to the lack of intimacy with Harry, he diverts resources to find out who her mystery man Simon (Bill Paxton) is and makes concerted efforts to track him down. Highlighting male insecurity regarding their spouses and inability to satisfy their urges as they expect they should be able to do, True Lies is a film that both tortures men over this area of weakness and gives great release. Upon finding Simon, beating him up, making him admit to have a \""little dick\"", and pee on himself, Harry is able to feel like a bigger man and more secure in his position as the only man in Helen's life. Even if she had strayed with Simon, Harry's presumably better endowment and full masculine confidence in every situation ensures that he could take Simon quite easily if it came down to it. It, like the rest of the film, is a fantasy-driven representation of men's desire to possess their significant others, outperform other men, and fulfill their significant other's every need. It is a competition to the very end in both life and the film."" ]";5
1656;brazil;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Simultaneously the second entry into Terry Gilliam's \""Trilogy of Imagination\"" and the first entry in his \""Dystopian Trilogy\"", Brazil is a masterwork of pure satirical genius. More aligned with modern day America than I am comfortable to admit, Brazil is a cautionary tale of government control where freedom is assumed, but is merely an illusion. Working in the Ministry of Information, Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) is a lowly worker who just does as he is told and keeps plugging along with no aspirations for anything better. Except, he keeps having dreams where he is a winged angel and trying to save a mystery girl. Learning that this girl is Jill Layton (Kim Greist), Sam tries to find her, only to discover that the government believes her to be a violent terrorist. Now, he must subvert the government to find the girl that he loves. A visually rich and thematically dense film, Brazil is a hard nut to crack and though this review will make it sound like I know what I am talking about, allow me to assure you that the opposite is in fact true."", ""In my review of Time Bandits, the first entry in the \""Trilogy of Imagination\"", I highlighted one of the major themes in that work as being materialism. With a psychotic obsession towards material items over their own child, Kevin's parents in that film ignore him at all costs. Gilliam continues this thematic discussion in Brazil, except it takes on a particularly politically charged tone. During the Cold War, the American government equated the communists with being godless heathens. Therefore, to be truly godly, one must be a capitalist. As such, spending and material goods are good and a glory to God. Throughout the film, Gilliam critiques this idea with a visual motif of a glowing blue cross in various shots, but also takes shots at the biggest glorification to capitalism in existence: Christmas. Setting Brazil during Christmas time allowed Gilliam to adorn each scene with a reference to the gift giving holiday. Everybody in the film has some asinine gift they are carrying or give to another person. Sam receives presents from nearly everybody he sees in the film and it is never something he truly wants. Interesting to note as well that nobody says \""Merry Christmas\"" in the film, rather they always say \""Happy Christmas\"". However, Gilliam ensures that this is a religious critique during a sequence in a shopping mall. One boy is carrying what appears to be a folder that reads, \""Consumers for Christ\"" on the cover. Similar to the glowing blue cross, this folder is also blue. Highlighting the capitalist indoctrination disguised as Christianity, Gilliam decries the linking together of religion and mindless consumption above all else. This is further emphasized through Sam's mother (Katherine Helmond) and her friend Mrs. Terrain (Barbara Hicks). The two are constantly getting face lifts to look younger and while Mrs. Lowry's goes fine, Mrs. Terrain is constantly shown with bandages due to her complications having complications. For Gilliam, this is a way of punishing the vanity and mindless materialism and consumption that has gone on in our present society."", ""This is further underscored in a callback to Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin and the famous Odessa steps sequence. In that famous sequence, people are gunned down on the Odessa steps by guards and, as she runs down, a mother's baby carriage gets stuck and begins to tumble down the steps. Gilliam takes this scene as inspiration towards the end as Sam has a dream about escaping from the prison he is held in. During his breakout - with the help of Archibald \""Harry\"" Tuttle (Robert De Niro) - the guards in the Ministry of Information are shooting at the escapees from the stairs and begin walking down them. As they do, a vacuum tumbles down the steps akin to the baby carriage in Battleship Potemkin. Here, Gilliam creates a parallel between the baby and the vacuum, in essence saying that we now serve machines and the system, instead of our children and one another. Our purpose and focus in life has shifted from each other to the soulless machines in the name of innovation. This is further confirmed, in hindsight, by a sequence earlier in the film. The chief torturer of the Ministry of Information is a friend of Sam's named Jack (Michael Palin). While visiting with Jack, Sam sees Jack speak to one of his three children. During this conversation, Jack calls the girl \""Amy\"" and later \""Chloe\"", despite the girl's protests that she is actually \""Holly\"". He seems disinterested and makes a crack about never really knowing anymore. For Jack and for everybody else living in this dystopian society, the only things that matter are work, consumption, and maintaining the status quo determined by those in power. All else fall by the waste side, especially family. Viewed in conjunction with the vacuum/baby carriage parallel, it is clear that Gilliam wishes to highlight this as a major fault in our present society."" ]";5

A thoroughly perplexing film, Stillman weaves in many different characters and ideologies into this film. Chloe Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale are fantastic here as foils (or are they?) in Stillman's wonderful look at friendships, relationships, and youth, set against the backdrop of the end of disco. At times, Stillman's packed dialogue filled with wordy attempts at brilliance can come off as awkward or pretentious, but in reality, they are astute critique of the type of individuals who say these types of things. For this and many other reasons, The Last Days of Disco is a brilliant exercise and an even better character study into these broken, envious, fake, human beings who like to present a facade of themselves that bears no resemblance with reality. Overall, The Last Days of Disco is a slyly comedic and thoroughly riveting social satire."" ]";5
1658;amistad;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Amistad is a masterfully crafted from the master of historical films, Steven Spielberg. With lavish costume design and a huge scope, Amistad is a mournful and moving look at one of the major battles before the Civil War came to be. The film's entire cast, especially Djimon Hounsou, do a terrific job here. Spielberg also does a great job himself (obviously) at keeping us focused on what truly matters here: the human element. The violence and even the essence of slavery and the court case take a backseat to exploring who these people are and why it matters who they are. Once we understand that, only then can we move into examining the impact of this case on history and the country. That said, Amistad is a bit of a slag at times. Though beautifully crafted with a good score from John Williams, it moves very slowly at times and as noticeably bad pacing. Essentially, it uses its runtime quite poorly and is excessive in length. It could have cut some time off and still have been just as impactful. That said, Amistad is a good film from Spielberg, even if it suffers from pacing issues."" ]";5

An actor's showcase, Beautiful Girls presents fantastic performances from Natalie Portman, Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon, Noah Emmerich, Michael Rapaport, Rosie O'Donnell, and Uma Thurman. Sweetly written, the sentimental nature of the film hits all the right notes and truly fills you up with nostalgia for the way things used to be and really uses this nostalgia as a good jumping off point to dive into its psychological musings.

He was terrific and put the film on his shoulders and absolutely killed it. The director, Tony Kaye, while he wishes to distance himself from the final product, he did a great job as well. There was some beautiful imagery here and while it may not be the version he intended as the final cut, his vision absolutely is here and the messages it provokes is still powerful. Really, after watching this film, I felt like I had been hit by a ton of bricks. The entire film is so moving and affecting that it really leaves you in a trance once it ends and the credits start rolling. On top of that, there are many powerful scenes, but none as powerful as the final one.

Though its outlandish and downright dark, Heathers is a comedy through and through that really sweeps you up in the comedy of it all without losing track of the larger issues being discussed. Teenage suicide, peer pressure, bullying, and general angst are all discussed in this worthy satire about high school cliques and mass murder.

The production and costume design here are also pitch perfect, as well as the 18th century medicinal techniques shown in the film. All really capture the period and help to put you into the film even more. In this tale of love and class, Sense and Sensibility does a great job creating realistic romances that really do break your heart when they fail and make you smile when they work.

1663;a-fish-called-wanda;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Written by Monty Python member John Cleese, it is truly a foregone conclusion that A Fish Called Wanda would be a truly hysterical film. However, it is the rare comedy that does not rely upon absurd plot happenings or even a plot at all. Though a heist comedy, it is a film about its characters due to Cleese's strong character writing with practically all of the humor being derived from their encounters with one another or what they will do to finally get their hands on the money at the end of the rainbow. A smart and witty film, A Fish Called Wanda is comedy with a brain, a great script, and absolutely phenomenal performances across the board. Thus, it becomes a truly well-rounded piece of entertainment that never misses a beat for the entirety of its runtime."", ""Starting off with a heist pulled off by craft George Thomason (Tom Georgeson), Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), sharpshooter Otto (Kevin Kline), and stutterer Ken (Michael Palin), A Fish Called Wanda takes a pretty typical turn when everybody quickly turns against one another after the heist, causing the score to get lost in the shuffle. Yet, like a Coen brothers film, the heist is just an excuse to begin to explore these characters so this narrative cliche is rather excusable. As the diamonds are hidden in some sort of safety deposit box that is in some hotel, near an iconic location, has a key, and is number something, it is required that the group of four work together to be able to get to those diamonds. However, with George in jail and Ken left for dead by Otto and Wanda, it seems as though that bit may be a tall task. Enter barrister Archie Leach (John Cleese). In a loveless marriage and the barrister for George, Archie is a prime target for the large breasted Wanda to use her tricks to get the necessary information from George to be able to find where the diamonds are locked up. While the diamonds are eventually found, it is truly a battle of attrition and one that often takes a backseat to the characters on display."", ""With this room to explore the characters, Cleese's incredibly smart script takes full advantage by developing the whole cast nicely, of which Otto and Archie really shine as the best figures in the film. A jealous and neurotic moron, Otto is an incredibly talented marksman, but a moron in every other walk of life. Introducing the running visual gag of having him pop up whenever girlfriend Wanda is set to sleep with Archie, Otto's presence in the film is always a welcome one. Showing him to be deeply unhinged and stupid, Cleese's script constantly establishes him as a figure who lacks any sense of sympathy. Criticizing Ken for his stutter, encouraging him to kill an old woman, calling any other driver whose car he hits an **** or insulting Ken again at the end of the film, Otto's stupidity does not just come from what he knows but in how he treats others. He is funny to watch thanks to Kevin Kline's incredible and well-deserved Oscar winning performance, but is certainly quite a villainous figure with just how sinister and cold he is towards everybody around him. If he cannot gain something out of a situation, he does not care. Lacking empathy and bordering on being a sociopath, Otto is an unhinged and loose cannon just waiting to implode."", ""Alongside Otto, Archie is a tremendous character. Trapped in this loveless marriage, poor Archie walks right into the bear trap that is Wanda with very little prodding whatsoever. She is sex personified and Archie is absolutely desperate, so it is a natural fit. A smart and capable barrister, Archie is a tad bit dead inside and the opportunity to run off with somebody like Wanda is a welcome one. While his descent into becoming a criminal may seem a bit much on the surface, for a man so cooped up and dependent on his wife, he is liable to do anything once given the leeway and freedom to actually make up his own mind and not deal with somebody's **** constantly. Portraying the character himself, John Cleese is outstanding. Infusing the film with great comedy in the writing of the character, Cleese's relatively straight performance that slowly becomes more-and-more comedic in nature as he ascends into freedom, Cleese plays this repressed and locked up husband figure terrifically and with great spirit. While Kline steals the show, Cleese's comedic performance consistently delivers laughs, while his dramatic performance early on convinces the audience that he is in fact an incredibly successful barrister."" ]";5

Though, this one is certainly brutal in many different ways as it did a great job developing its characters. Many war films go for action rather than character development, but here, we got a bit of both and really became connected to the soldiers. This connection made the events here all the more tragic and hard to watch. The acting here is great, especially from R. Lee Ermey, who really steals the show. Stanley Kubrick's direction is fabolous as expected as well. The first half here is also far superior to the second half, in large part thanks to Ermey, but really, all of the events in the first half are much better presented than the second half, which at times, can be a little odd in the way things occur. But, the second half is still quite good, even if a little bit of a drop off from the perfect first half. Overall, Full Metal Jacket is a very good film that presents the trauma faced by soldiers in war very well and while no war film is completely unique, this one takes familiar elements and improves upon them."" ]";5

However, my favorite part was certainly the little touches throughout. I don't really have a specific example, but images in the background or a small reference here and there that were absolutely fantastic. In its use of sight gags, Bulworth is similar to an Abrahams, Zucker, and Zucker, 80s comedy, except politically focused.

1667;snake-eyes;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""I would like to motion for a critical reappraisal of Brian De Palma's absolutely terrific Snake Eyes. Terrifically thrilling, Snake Eyes features Nicolas Cage as Richard Santoro, a charismatic and corrupt Atlantic City police detective who witnesses an assassination during a boxing match. Supported by a strong supporting performance from Gary Sinise as Commander Kevin Dunne, Snake Eyes is a spellbinding conspiracy thriller that is terrific to the very last drop."", """", ""Featuring all of De Palma's major trademarks, Snake Eyes is a showcase for his lovely camera work. The tracking shot at the very beginning of Richard Santoro walking through the arena is terrific, but what makes it all the much better is De Palma's repeated use of split-screen later on in the film that showcases how perception changes everything. For Santoro, he believed he knew what had occurred during the shooting. He thought he knew the players. It was only through speaking to Julia Costello (Carla Gugino) and Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw) that his eyes were opened. De Palma does a terrific job of using the split-screen to showcase the different perspectives a situation can have and how that can lead to false conclusions if you do not have both takes on a situation."", """", ""The camera work also comes into play when Julia is going up to a man's room and the camera pans through an aerial shot of the rooms on the floor. While it may not add much to the overall film, it was incredibly stylish and highlighted a very important element to the story: it was not about the assassination. In every room, people were either celebrating something completely unrelated or changing the channel from the news. For De Palma, this essentially serves to refocus the audience on what actually matters: the characters. Having read the critical reception, I was particularly struck by a quote from De Palma himself in which he stated, \""There's a lot of discussion in Snake Eyes about why do we reveal who did it so soon. Well the problem is that it isn't about who did it. It's a mystery about a relationship, two people, and how finding that out affects their relationship... Those kind of procedural movies are extremely boring...\"" In essence, for me, many critics wind up missing the point of the film. While I loved it a conspiracy thriller and thought it was thoroughly captivating in this regard, De Palma's aim was to showcase the fracturing of the friendship between Santoro and Dunne when Santoro finds out the truth about his long time friend. Thus, the sequence in which he shows everyone ignoring the news of the assassination, it becomes clear that De Palma is trying to nudge the audience away from the murder mystery aspect and onto the character study."", """", ""As a character study, the film is equally riveting. Richard Santoro's reaction to the news, as relayed to him by Julia Costello who was revealing the conspiracy to the assassinated Secretary of Defense when the killing happened, is perfection. Cage brings the emotions to life and wears them on his sleeve in this sequence as you can see Santoro's heartbreak and, at first, deny that this is what occurred. His dedication to his friend is being tested, but he knows that it is true. When he finds video evidence confirming what she had told him was true, his heartbreak over losing his childhood friend is shattering and tremendous cinema. This is truly where the writing from David Koepp excels, as he manages to develop his characters so well, while also subtly keeping them within their characters even if its seems out-of-character, if that makes sense. For Santoro, he is established as being an adulterer and a corrupt cop. Yet, he wants to be mayor, which is why he wants to solve this case. For him, he may put on a facade of being charismatic and magnanimous, but deep down, he wants more than his current lot in life. For Kevin Dunne, he may seem like the \""goody two shoes\"", but instead he is ruthless and manipulative, willing to do anything to get ahead. These characters truly come to life thanks to the writing from Koepp."", """", ""Another element captured incredibly well by De Palma is the chaos. This element is really put on display during the assassination, which is a chaotic, thrilling, and hectic sequence that is equally hectically shot. You can hardly tell what is going on and can feel your own heart beating as this sequence unfolds. This feeling is sustained throughout the film, in large part due to the free flowing camera of De Palma. It truly captures the significant amount of moving parts within the film and the chaos, as the long tracking shots emphasize. In particular, the opening tracking shot involves numerous different moments that could be a scene all on their own. Santoro runs into many different people and the camera struggles to keep up with him."" ]";5

What really makes this film work is the acting. The performance by John Lone as the adult Puyi, as well as the child actors who portray Puyi in his younger years is marvelous, as is the supporting work turned in by Peter O'Toole.

I am not a huge fan of Steven Soderbergh usually, but he does very well here in the director's chair and manages to craft a very entertaining romantic crime film and make the romance feel authentic and the crime element thrilling and exciting. In addition, the comedy element was good. It was not gut busting laugh after gut busting laugh, but it was used sparingly and effectively to lighten up the mood. Overall, Out of Sight is a good, entertaining film that feels like more than your regular old heist film."" ]";5

With strong lead performances from Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon, as well as the rest of the cast. Really the true star here is the people who handled the color, which is just unreal. The blending of color and black and white....just wow. When it transitions in a scene so seamlessly, it is truly something to behold. Director Gary Ross does a good job blending the social commentary with sheer family values demonstrated by this stereotypical 50's television show that blends with the real world in this film. The pacing is good and the storytelling keeps everything clear even as things steadily get me complex. Overall, Pleasantville is decidedly pleasant, even if the characters begin to believe that things in their little bubble are becoming unpleasant."" ]";5
1673;the-american-president;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Loved this. Though it is a typical romantic comedy in many respects, Aaron Sorkin is such a talented writer, he manages to reinvent the wheel. Charming, cute, and sweet romantically, while tough, smart, and poignant politically, The American President is a really top-notch film that is a masterclass in writing. Every word of dialogue oozes with power and weight, while demonstrating Sorkin's talent at creating incredibly well developed characters. Even better, the perfect writing allows this tremendous cast led by Michael Douglas, Annette Bening, Martin Sheen, and Michael J. Fox to really take off and soar. Not only is the character development top-notch here, but it is a truly compelling and poignant look at politics and the presidency, especially the interesting idea as to what would transpire if the President dated during this age of the media. Comedically, the film is incredibly smart, quick, and witty, showing that Sorkin is just as adept at writing a hilarious film as he is a smart one. Overall, The American President is a showcase for all the Sorkinisms that make his writing so damn perfect. Though typical, the film is so well-written, those cliches are ignorable because this is those cliches at their very best. Hard to imagine these cliches being better executed."" ]";5
1674;primary-colors;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Compared to the other politically-based comedy drama of 1998, Bulworth, Primary Colors is not quite as good. While its first hour and fourty-five minutes hums by, nimbly treading the line between fact and fiction with a comedic and satirical kick, its final fourty minutes are far too somber and tonally off from the rest of the film. A unique take on the lying and manipulation politicians embark on with Democratic presidential candidate Jack Stanton (John Travolta) leading the charge as a Bill Clinton type man. Alongside him is his wife Susan (Emma Thompson) who must endure scandal after scandal that proves the levels to which Jack has cheated on her and betrayed her trust. Yet, she sticks behind me. Why? Because through all the lies and dishonesty, Jack Stanton is a man who can change America. She knows it and so does his wide-eyed campaign chairman Henry Burton (Adrian Lester), who is the audience surrogate to this world of dirty politics, plotting, and spinning. Funny, smart, and honest, Primary Colors may be bit too dark at the end to really pull it off, but the film mostly works."", ""In the beginning two-thirds of the film, director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Elaine May write a ripping yarn about a presidential candidate that may be a scumbag womanizer who impregnates underage girls, but he cares. To be President, one does not necessarily need to be a great man and Bill Clinton, er, Jack Stanton is a perfect representation of that fact. This does not preclude his wife Susan from taking it to heart, as is gracefully portrayed by Emma Thompson who shows the grace and harm the sexual freedom of Stanton's nature has on her. But, it also does not preclude him from becoming President as Henry Burton soon learns. Hired to be his campaign manager, Burton left another man's campaign to work for Stanton because of one thing: belief. His past employer talked a good game and knew how to convince people, but he was not going to fight for anybody. He was just a politician. Stanton is different, however. He is a worse man than the other guy, but he cares about these people. To the people who worked in manufacturing, he honestly told them he would not get their jobs back, but would work to find something new. He fights for adult literacy and education programs as a result, doing the ground work in that area. He has a conversation without cameras around with a man who has worked since the age of 14 and cannot afford good health care in a Krispy Kreme at 4am. He greets people in the pouring rain on polling day. He talks to the elderly about issues that mean the world to them. Now, he may not always tell the truth to these people. For example, he lies about his own uncle's literacy level. But, he does mean well. He lies to get them on his team, not to mislead them. The things he says and the things that touch his heart are not fake, they are things he truly wishes to change and he wants to fight for the common American. Contrary to many other politicians, he is not all bark with no bite. He barks just as loudly, but his bite is just as ferocious."", ""This authenticity is mirrored in his early approach to negative campaigning. He wants it to be about the issues and not just because of his skeletons. He believes the American people deserve to hear about the issues and he plans on doing just that. By the time he uncovers the dirt about Governor Fred Picker (Larry Hagman) though, he knows he must play dirty to save the party. While he fails the test of Libby Holden (Kathy Bates), who hoped he would stick to his guns and not play dirty, he knows it is a necessary evil. If he wants these people to get help as he sees necessary, the Democrats must win. If he does not hit Picker with these revelations, the Republicans will and the Democrats will lose the election. For the good of the party, he must make Picker drop out. This is tragic obviously and clearly shakes both him and Henry, but politics demand getting dirty to promote your ideals. It is why negative campaigning is often necessary. Candidates must give people a reason not to vote for the other person, not to promote themselves as clean. This mud slinging comes from the need of politicians to ensure their agenda and policies are promoted. If the other guy wins, things will not go to plan. In portraying this moral dilemma, Nichols' film really soars. Balancing the charisma of Travolta in the lead role, his scandals, and the absurd things that occur for the first two-thirds of the film, Primary Colors really strikes a chord. It is incredibly real and never stops being so, but it is also impeccably funny. It shows how absurd it can all be, while finding comedy in smart places and never stretching the jokes to cover up true social critique. At the end of the day, it paints Stanton as a bad man with a good heart. Susan and Henry stay with him because of this. Through all the bad press and lies, he wants to make a difference and is naive and idealistic about America."" ]";5
1675;titanic;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""As a whole, Titanic is certainly a pretty good film. The strongest element of this is the production elements. While outdated by the time I watched it, for 1997 it is very good. In addition, the disaster sequences were brilliantly executed and put together to perfection. It reminded me positively of 1970's classics The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno. Both are seen as the pinnacle of disaster films and this one certainly echoes those and improves on them thanks to advancements in technology. In addition, the film certainly has its beautiful moments. While the romance may be poured on a little thick at times, it certainly really shines at times and makes you feel chills all over. Leonardo DiCaprio is also good as Jack Dawson, though he does falter at times, in large part due to poor writing. I did not like the writing for much of this one and the lines were laughable at times. In addition, Kate Winslet's performance left much to be desired. She had her moments where she was great, but when paired with a much stronger actor in DiCaprio, he left her in the dust far too often. The supporting cast was strong for the most part, however, which was good. As a whole, Titanic succeeds most in capturing the atmosphere and events surrounding the Titanic. Both the sinking and aftermath of it are brilliantly moving and engrossing, which stand as the best part of the film to me. It certainly has its negatives, but Titanic gets more negative reviews than it deserves due to the at times sappy and unbelievable romance element, which is too bad."" ]";5

I was very skeptical heading into this one as I am not head over heels with Keanu Reeves and am not a fan of Laurence Fishburne at all, yet both turned in good performances. The plot is very complex, but once you wrap your head around it and begin to understand everything, it becomes very enjoyable and easy watching. In fact, it shocked me how straight forward it wound up being, as I expected it to be far more confounding. I am typically not a huge science fiction fan, but this one really wound up working for me and though the shoved in romantic elements bother me as always. On top of that, how it pretty much turns into an action film (especially towards the end) is another sour note here. However, as I said, it was still very enjoyable and very well done."" ]";5

In terms of the story, I thought it, as well, was beautifully presented. From the early encounters to the very end, there is a certain beauty to the interaction between the characters as Dunbar adjusts to his new situation. In terms of the acting, Kevin Costner and a cast of relative unknowns did a great job. Initially, I was unsure about Costner and did not like his performance that much in the beginning, but as the film progressed, he won me over completely. The final note I want to make is on the length. It is three hours, so it is up there in terms of time, but it never really shows its length.

However, the fact that it is a part of the Criterion Collection gave me significant cognitive dissonance. After watching it, Armageddon is unabashedly stupid and if films such as Top Gun, Days of Thunder, and Independence Day, did not exist, I would call it the stupidest film of all-time. Yet, just as with those films, I am unashamed supporter of Armageddon. It may be dumb, but it is a film about human perseverance in times of turmoil and has a heart that is proudly wears on its sleeve."", """", ""Though I would be hard pressed to call the acting good, it is never anything worse than average, which is just fine for the perfect example of when the Hollywood machine can churn out a film with a strong directorial vision courtesy of Michael Bay that showcases all that he does right. While it is dumb and loud, Bay's ability to create emotion, thrills, and tension never shines through better than in this film and he, unlike in other endeavors, gets overly side tracked by bad jokes or dumb plots. Instead, he stays honed in on what matters and, even better, the jokes delivered by Steve Buscemi from beginning to end all hit. In fact, they may be one of the best parts of the film."", """", ""As with Independence Day, it is hard not be in awe of this film at times. A glorious piece of 1990s cheesy action, Armageddon is filled with impactful one liners that give you chills, action set pieces that thrill, and an uncanny ability to make me fight back tears while watching a film about exploding an asteroid by drilling a hole into it. The tender scenes between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler, the interactions between Tyler and Bruce Willis, as well as those between Willis and Affleck are all heart breaking put together. Beautifully shot, orchestrated, and written, these particular character interactions stand out in a film that knows how to write camaraderie between its character, especially the drillers."", """", ""While its action is obvious, the writing is really what elevates this. The plot may be dumb, but what is not dumb about Armageddon is its ability to create human characters with heart, passion, fears, and shortcomings. The development of their relationships and backgrounds is very impressive for a film of this type. This writing is what got it included in the Criterion Collection and it is not undeserved. The plot may be silly, but those behind the script knew what they were doing and knew how to write an action film. Plot be damned, Armageddon packs an emotional punch while Bay manages to expertly give weight and balance the romance, passion, and action in one deliciously put together spectacle."", """", ""Armageddon may be one of the dumbest movies ever in terms of plot, but its writing and willingness to explore the bonds between father-daughter and grown men is an impressive feat for a blockbuster of this type. Color me surprised that this Michael Bay-led disaster was anything but a misguided attempt to entertain teenage boys. Instead stark contrast to initial expectations, Armageddon has a soul where its brain should be, which is more than satisfying enough."" ]";5
1682;shallow-grave;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Killing and dismembering a person changes people, as does coming into a lot of money in one fortunate stroke of luck. Danny Boyle's directorial debut Shallow Grave explores just how much one changes when a trio of friends stumble a dead roommate and a suitcase full of cash, only to then wind up in the crosshairs of the cops and gangsters that are closing in fast. Driven to insanity, this black comedy crime film features some of Boyle's trademark fast-paced action and music, but does feel like a debut film. It really does not distinguish itself too much from other crime films at the time and is pretty thinly plotted. That said, the film is incredibly entertaining, well acted, and showed incredible promise for Boyle."", ""The star here though is Christopher Eccleston. A reserved, innocent, and dorky accountant, his David is brilliant. Driven over the edge after he and his friends find the body and the cash, his change is spurred on by being the guy charged with burying and dismembering the body. He is unable to cope with what he has done and the added stress on his psyche, being driven into madness. Holing up in the attic and frightening both Juliet (Kerry Fox) and Alex (Ewan McGregor), Eccleston plays an unhinged psychotic incredibly well. He really steals the show here and provides a performance that anchors the film incredibly well. One could argue that this is another film about average working men revolting against their boring jobs, even if David does find some enjoyment out of being an accountant. However, even his boss says that accountants are boring. Therefore, it is essentially his revolt against the monotonous life he leads as a timid, reserved people. Killing unleashes his wild side and gives him a shot of adrenaline like no other and it is one that is highly addictive."", ""Alongside him, Ewan McGregor and Kerry Fox turn in good performances as well in the film that is noteworthy for launching McGregor's career. Both are solid as more straight-laced characters compared to the unhinged Eccleston. That said, they both are punished violently for their actions in the film with helping with the burying of the bodies. The two of them really do bring the film back to Earth a bit, but their best scene definitely comes as they become more unhinged as well at the end. Out for themselves, the film reaches a very dark comedic finale with terrifically maniacal acting on the part of Fox and McGregor in the closing sequence. That said, the only part that truly feels like Boyle is the opening. With fast-paced music and the cruelly interviewing potential new flatmates while mocking them openly, the quick cuts and general pace feel like Boyle. It is in this opening that he really found his style and it is a shame to see the rest of the film be far more reserved and less indulgent of the typical kinetic nature of his work. The end result is a film that simply feels less polished and stylish than we have become accustomed to from the British director. But, what he does manage to do incredibly well is make the film feel alive. The material is quite derivative at times, especially when with some influence with the Coen brothers' love of having characters steal or fall into a briefcase of money, only to lose it at the end and nobody gets the money. Boyle's film feels similar at times in that regard as he finds comedy in odd places and makes the derivative plot feel fresh and new. Though we know it is not, Boyle's approach is always compelling and distracts from the predictable nature of the storyline. Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a good comparison, though less self-indulgent than that film and it does also feel a bit more unpolished and hesitant. This is a by-product of it being Boyle's debut, albeit one that hinted at the great things to come."", ""A largely quite predictable and derivative black comedy crime film, Shallow Grave has that \""familiar-yet-fresh\"" feel of many 1990s crime films.

1683;dead-ringers;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Directors of horror films or just weird movies in general tend to gravitate towards tales of identical or siamese twins. David Cronenberg is no different as he demonstrates in Dead Ringers. Based on a true story to a certain degree, the film tells the story of Beverly and Elliott Mantle (Jeremy Irons), twin gynecologists who often pretend to be one another, even with women such as actress Claire Niveau (Genevieve Bujold). Unfortunately for them, this \""pretending\"" is really a manifestation of their affliction: they are siamese twins that are not connected. Their bodies and souls are one, even if their brains go elsewhere. As a result, one becoming addicted to drugs has a detrimental effect on the duo. Featuring class Cronenberg psychology and body horror, Dead Ringers is a creepy and unsettling film from beginning to end."", ""Featuring Jeremy Irons in a tremendous dual role, Dead Ringers explores the inner working of the mind of a twin who is unmistakably connected to their twin. Messing with their mind and interfering with their daily lives, this connection is one neither is truly aware of or able to cope with. Irons plays these two tormented souls drifting between the calm, cool, and collected nature of them initially during undergrad and when they begin their careers to when their twisted insides and mutant nature interferes on their daily lives and turns both into dying drug addicts who have lost their minds. Deeply psychological, Irons convincingly brings to life the fractured nature of these men's psyches and deftly shows the impact it has on their daily lives with Claire or any of their patients."", ""Cronenberg, for his part, never truly exploits the situation or the afflictions of his character. Rather, as he is prone to do, he explores the difference. The mutant nature and convoluted interiors of a siamese/identical twin is on full display here, as well as the mental torment it can cause for a person. In exploring this dark side of the human mind, Cronenberg naturally finds a lot of horror and effectively delivers scares to the audience via the torment the characters go through. Above all, his trademark body horror comes into play throughout and at the very end. Surgery and gynecology are a natural fit for Cronenberg, especially when the men believe they are looking at mutant women with weird insides. This paranoia and weird bit of body horror is vintage Cronenberg in how he has fun with messing up the human body and finding horror by making the audience's skin crawl as weird surgical tools are used in operation or people are cut open. The film is very visceral in this front as can be expected. It is also where much of the horror can be found, particularly with the violent psychological body horror finale when Beverly tries to separate them as conjoined twins, even though they are not actually conjoined."", ""Messed up, twisted, and classic Cronenberg, Dead Ringers may not be nearly as effective in creating scares or messing with one's mind as some of his best work, but it does succeed in creating a creepy atmosphere for Jeremy Irons to have terrific fun with. Irons is creepy, weird, and oddly charismatic in the role as the two twins, playing two distinctly different people who just happen to share a deep, deep connection. This atmosphere lends itself to the excellent character study, writing, and embracing of the more psychological and twisted elements brought forth by the film. Though perhaps not as great of a study of the mind as his later film Spider, the film still explores this unique mental illness to chilling effect, making up for its \""lesser\"" character study with more effective scares and chills. Though hardly one of Croneberg's weirder films, Dead Ringers is oddly reserved for this period in his career and, aside from a few gross out scenes, is largely far more mental and less focused on absurd elements such as the underground. Instead, Dead Ringers is about the connection between twins seen through the eyes of a master of body horror. The end result is just as good as one could expect."" ]";5

Had it been released in the 1940s or 1950s, with some small tweaks, it would have been right at home. In 1992, it served as a last beacon of a bygone era in film. Directed by Carl Franklin, One False Move is a Southern-set film about three people - Ray Malcolm (Billy Bob Thornton), Fantasia (Cynda Williams), and Pluto (Michael Beach) - that kill six people and rip off a drug dealer. Headed to Star City, Arkansas after hoping to have sold the drugs in Houston, LAPD detectives Dud Cole (Jim Metzler) and John McFeely (Earl Billings) head to Arkansas to wait for them. In Arkansas, they are greeted by Dale \""Hurricane\"" Dixon (Bill Paxton), the Chief of Police in the small city. A rough and tumble neo-noir, One False Move has flaws, but is also a tightly wound yarn that keeps you guessing till very last drop."", ""One False Move is one of those films that is incredibly meticulous. The staging is detailed, every word and action is precise and carries great meaning and purpose. There are no throwaway lines or scenes that could be cut to trim any fat. The film is tightly plotted and written. Billy Bob Thornton's script is streamlined and explores a few subplots, but they all contribute to the main plot. For this to be his first produced script, it is incredibly impressive and shows the talent he has as a writer. Yet, the film is quintessential noir in the sense that it is entirely character-driven. Though the plot is important and one that entertains, the characters are really what makes the film sing. This does lead to some problems in the script, but the characters never cease to be entertaining and the actors all bring solid performances to the table that justify the character focus of the film."", ""However, the film's greatest fault in its characters is how it rests on cultural stereotypes as a shorthand. Dale Dixon, the Arkansas cop, is an over-eager and bubbly fellow who is like a kid at Spring Training yelling for his favorite ballplayer to come sign a baseball for him. He wants to go to Los Angeles and become a cop after this experience and cannot get enough of the LA detectives and the fact that the crime spree is coming to him. The classic smalltown kind of guy from the South, he says the n-word a lot casually. The town of Star City similarly involves cliches with Dale and Fantasia/Lyla Walker having a history that the film seems to believe is a twist, but just typing the words above give it away. It is not a well-hidden secret and one, once hinted at, will become incredibly easy to pick out. Again, it is quite cliche in that element. The LA cops even represent cultural cliches with both feeling above the Arkansas cop, who is not a \""real cop\"". Laughing at his dream to go west and be a cop there, they are self-absorbed jerks who drink their own kool-aid. In other words, they are big city cops that believe they are God's gift to police work. While the script is still terrific, these cultural stereotypes are a bit of a short hand in lieu of unique characterization."", ""However, in the less character-focused moments, One False Move continues to provide excellent entertainment. Thrilling, edge-of-your-seat sequences such as simple ones in a gas station, being followed on the Texas highway, or the final shootout, the film keeps you guessing and in complete suspense. The film takes its time, never rushing through intense moments and instead allowing the audience to feel every drop of suspense possible. In many ways, it is akin to the recent release, Hell or High Water. It is a country-fried thriller dipped in BBQ, highlighted in One False Move's diegetic score towards the end with the harmonica. It really sets the tone perfectly and, if the country roads were not an indicator, it highlights the country."", ""One False Move is a terrific neo-noir. Involving a very detailed and thrilling plot, the film is character-driven with the characters taking centerstage. Though they can be a bit cliched, they never stop entertaining the audience with each beat of the story that happens. One False Move's biggest sin is that is can be a predictable, but it more than make up for it with its incredibly written dialogue, characters, and plot that are not smartly put together, but incredibly detailed and highly engrossing. A small film that was fashioned as a straight-to-DVD release in 1992, One False Move is still greatly overlooked in the world of cinema and that is a shame. Though hardly groundbreaking, the tight direction from Carl Franklin, good cast, and incredibly well-written script make the film one that should not be missed."" ]";5
1689;sex-lies-and-videotape;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The fact that this is a debut is astounding, as is the fact that I used to not like Steven Soderbergh. Honestly, for sure a talented guy, he is often somebody I forget about, even if I enjoy his films. Years ago, my first introduction was The Informant, which I actually walked out of in theaters. That may have been a mistake, but I still need to rewatch (or fully watch) it to find out for sure. Afterwards, I watched Contagion and hated it, becoming fully convinced that he was a hack. Of course, as my recent rewatch showed, my opinion on Contagion has changed a lot. Since seeing these two long ago, I have seen and loved many of his works including Traffic, Solaris, Side Effects, Out of Sight, and I am even an apologist for his throwback 2006 bomb The Good German. Tobey Maguire may be a miss in the movie, but it is still a great take on 1940s noir, dammit! Now, this introductory paragraph exists largely because this is his first feature. Often times, watching a debut from a director whose work you enjoy proves disappointing. Sex, Lies, and Videotape, however, is not your typical work. An exploration into human sexuality with a raw, unhinged, and delightfully odd script, the film may lack the polish of his later works, but there is terrific wealth in that lack of polish."", ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape is about the arrival of a mysterious man, Graham (James Spader), who used to be friends in college with John (Peter Gallagher). Previously incredibly promiscuous, Graham is now impotent and only able to perform alone. As such, he videotapes women talking about sex and their history of having sex. This sometimes can get a little sensual, but Graham never actually does anything with a subject and is strict with nobody else seeing a tape. One of the women he tapes, Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) has heard about Graham from her sister Ann (Andie MacDowell). Repulsed by his tapes, Ann tries to stop her sexually liberal sister from seeing him, but Cynthia cannot be stopped. Of course, the awkward part is that Ann is very reserved and is married to Graham's old friend John, who is now a successful lawyer. John, meanwhile, is sleeping with Cynthia who sleeps with him to get back at her older sister."", ""As may be clear, this creates some issues, but it really creates some odd healing. This confrontation of their approach to sex and their pasts allows the characters to really confront why they are the way that they are. For Ann, she is able to find herself and figure out why she does not enjoy sex. For Cynthia, it allows her to confront why she hates Ann and work on a worthwhile way of healing that. In the process, of course, it does show a lot about their characters. The sisters fight because they are inherently different and the other cannot accept that difference. It is also clear that Cynthia does a lot of what she does for attention, hinting at the popularity of Ann in school among the boys and, likely, her parents. Thus, it gives her a rush to know she is sleeping with Ann's husband and is better at sex than her. Via the videotapes, however, the women are able to figure this out and identify these issues. At the end, when we see Ann give Cynthia her work number and a gift, it becomes clear that the olive branch is there. Though they talked and had a relationship, they only spoke of each negatively and had terrible conversations on the phone. It is clear that the relationship is fractured and confronting what has made them who they are and driven them apart (sex), allows them to heal and work on the relationship."", ""This development is incredibly written by Soderbergh who creates a nuanced plot with nuanced characters that really grow throughout the film. For a debut, this is quite the accomplishment, especially with the mature way in which he handles sex. Instead of exploiting it or turning it into simple titillation, he turns it into an act worthy of psycho-therapeutic study. Of course, the strong characters and dialogue are bolstered by good performances in all roles, particularly by James Spader. As the unusual and very open Graham, Spader oozes weird yet comforting. His oddities may be a turn off to those who do not know him, but for that those do, he is an welcome part of their lives."", ""Incredibly written, directed, and acted, this one is a shockingly assured debut. While imperfect, the film is one that leaves you sitting there and contemplating your life in a weird way, just as the characters here are forced to assess who they are and where they are. In this film, it is an incredibly impactful film that shows Soderbergh's talent in transcending genre and creating intimate and compelling stories no matter the topic."" ]";5

It was hard to pick my jaw up from the floor at times when seeing the beautiful images he managed to construct. In addition, the special effects are phenomenal. For 2014 they are great, let alone for 1968. Just absolutely stunning to watch. The sets are also brilliantly put together. In terms of sound, the soundtrack is phenomenal and is a great companion to the images. The acting here is solid, but that was all that was required, as there is not that much dialogue where acting is crucial, but they were competent and in the more dialogue carried sequences did well. This film is undoubtedly tough to grasp after watching it, but there is certainly more going on than meets the eye.

Fantastically funny and a great look at high school in the 1970s, Dazed and Confused is a fun and enjoyable ride that may start off a bit odd, but once it hits its stride, it's a true joy. The ensemble cast is fantastic and it is tragic that a lot of them did not get any major roles after this, aside from this obvious few because they are all a delight. Matthew McConaughey does steal the show though of course with his multiple iconic lines that will continue to live on forever.

From the major tonal shift to the fact that it exists as a decent movie in many different genres, and to the fact that it stars George Clooney viciously killing vampires, From Dusk Till Dawn is quite the experience. It is never truly a horror film in the sense that it scares you, but it is one in the sense that it truly just lingers within you. Once you watch this one, you have become the undead and will never switch back. Weird turn after weird turn reveal a wildly entertaining if over-the-top film that truly never fails to live up to my expectations for it. It is not a great film, but is a fun one and has some classic Tarantino writing and gore, plus a good performance from George Clooney, and solid direction form Robert Rodriguez. A Tarantino-Clooney-Rodriguez group project can never truly can too awry, now can it? Overall, this one is a nice, light break from more serious horror films during the lead up to any Halloween."" ]";5
1693;thief;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The feature-length debut for Michael Mann, Thief shows off Mann's tidy camerawork, ear for a great score, and his ability to craft smart thrillers. Starring James Caan, Thief is a neo-noir film about a man, essentially, looking to do one last job before settling down, but his ties to the mob makes this impossible. Tense, thrilling, and blessed with great acting, music, and direction, Thief is a powerhouse of a crime film."", ""Firstly, the acting in the film is first-rate. James Caan stars as Frank. His Frank is a very complicated mobster, balancing brilliance with welding tools used to crack locks with a deep desire to have a family. He is, in many ways, an incredibly relatable man in this regard. Caan really brings this element to life and balances the character's brilliance, rage, and compassion. When he and the audience realize there is no way out for him, the film and Caan manage to create a great deal of empathy. All of this empathy is earned through his speech to Jessie (Tuesday Weld) in the bar. One of the iconic scenes of the film, Frank pours his heart out to Jessie and explains why he wants her in his life."", ""Aside from Caan, the other character who really grabs this film by the horns is Leo (Robert Prosky). The aging mob boss, Leo is a ruthless man. He may take care of those who help him, but make no mistake, Leo will do anything to make a profit. This is emphasized in his final speech to Frank when he lays everything out for him as to why he will continue to work for him. From threatening his family, threatening to prostitute his wife, and more, Leo is a menacing figure who instills great fear. Prosky captures this perfectly, yet nimbly transitions between that intensity to the scene following, in which one of his henchmen asks if he wants milk to which Leo replies, \""No I'm fine\"". Seemingly innocuous, this moment really shows the two sides of the character - between ruthless mobster and typical old man - that Prosky really does a stellar job bringing to life."", ""In terms of the camera work, there are some seriously terrific shots here courtesy of Mann. Particularly, the sequence in the home when Frank breaks in and when Frank is breaking into the lock for the \""big score\"". In the former, which happens later, Mann laces the film with a lot of tension through quick sweeping turns with the camera and of Caan himself. His fear is evident and permeates to the audience, leaving us completely on the edge of our seats. In the robbery sequence, a lot of this same tension occurs, but really is just eye candy at times when the orange flame encompasses the entire frame. One of the most notable shots utilized here, however, has to be the repeated upside down shots. There are two major moments I can think of, one because it looks good and the other because of the moment it captures. The former is of Frank driving his black car and we see nothing but the hood and the lights of the city glistening off its sleek black coat. Pure eye candy. The latter is when Leo is threatening Frank. The entire time, Leo is upside down and thinks really creates an effect further discomforting the viewer and Frank. Though the scene is intense on its own due to the language used by Leo, Mann increases the tension further through this shot by making it feel wholly foreign and uncomfortable."", ""Musically, Thief is incredible. Somehow, this score was nominated for a Razzie, but I guess that just shows how smart the people who run that award show are. Often rousing and always instilled with this psychedelic(?) rock-and-roll sound, the score for Thief can often consume a shot and further elevate the intensity of the moment. Really, a lot of this film is intended to create discomfort for the audience. The score really accomplishes this throughout, even if it is pleasing to the ears for the most part. It can be quite jarring and unsettling when it crescendos and truly leaves you trying to escape its grasp."", ""Thief is a thrilling and exciting crime film with some flaws - namely an underdeveloped element with Okla (Willie Nelson) - and some poor character development for people not named Frank or Leo, but the film remains a powerful thriller. Mann knows thrills and tension and is not afraid to show it off, as demonstrated in Thief, which truly embodies his trademarks and knowledge of how to leave his audience dying for more."" ]";5

It had a nice build-up to key, intense scenes and then a slight drop off, before another build up to an even more intense scene. It may be called \""The Boxer\"", but as is made evident in the film, this one is about a lot more than boxing.

1696;deconstructing-harry;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Deconstructing Harry is another one of those pseudo-philosophical and pseudo-intellectual comedy-dramas by Woody Allen that is highly semi-autobiographical. Except, this one actually just comes out and admits this fact. Focused on writer Harry Block (Allen), a philandering, nihilistic, atheist, Jewish, and misanthropic man, Deconstructing Harry is the film that Allen had always made, but never this upfront with the film's central character admitting that all of his characters and work are informed by his own experience. Of course, there is another layer to the madness with the life of Harry Block being heavily informed by Allen's own experiences and own determinations about his character as a human being. Funny, compelling, and introspective, Deconstructing Harry is perhaps one of Allen's most ambition amalgamations of his scattered and fragmented mind and, though the results are a bit more mixed, they are always impeccably admirable."", ""Sending Harry through the ringer where he is called a loser by everybody around him, put to task for his own self-hatred, and called out on his philandering and lying, Deconstructing Harry is Allen's own admission of guilt. He throws his hands up and admits that, yes, he has screwed up repeatedly. He has hurt those who loved him and cannot understand why anybody would leave him. He makes up fictional worlds because he cannot live in the real one without having to confront real emotions. For a man his age, he is deathly afraid of growing up and having to confront the fact that he is a jerk. Yet, in spite of this, he has no intentions of changing. In conversations with Larry (Billy Crystal), it quickly becomes clear that, though his nostalgia for the past holds a special place in his heart, it is also a part of his life that he is not entirely willing to let go of quite yet. He is a man who always wants his cake and to eat it too with a complete lack of understanding as to why other people will not allow this type of behavior. He is afraid of retribution and, as such, hides himself in his stories. Unable to write due to writer's block, however, it is time for Harry to wake up and smell the coffee."", ""While Allen has previously gotten quite self-referential - see Stardust Memories and Radio Days - this film is perhaps his most openly personal. It is not hard to see the parallels between the maligned Harry and Allen's own personal life. Neurotic and always making the wrong choice in his personal life, he invites controversy and has been the recipient of such by anybody with any sort of moral definition in their life. Even as a lover of his films, it is hard to deny that Allen does not have a deeply troubled personal life with many different crosses he is forced to bear. Deconstructing Harry is, essentially, Allen's own admission of this truth. While clearly not mentioning any intent to change or to alter his way of existence from how he currently operates, it is at least admitting that he has been bad to women, is a self-hating Jew who mocks Jews and religious folks out of this self-hatred, and he is impeccably nihilistic, neurotic, and misanthropic to the point that he is deeply depressed. If there is a wrong step, he takes it and that is exactly how Harry acts in this film. This certainly makes this film the easiest acting job ever put in by Allen with no real character to get into, but as a writer-director, he is given a great challenge. Everybody knows it is himself, so how can he handle it without seeming too self-affirming? By making Harry about repugnant with no redeeming qualities. He betrays everybody, cheats on every woman he is with, and then has no idea why everybody hates him. It is easy to hate Harry and Allen knows this and this is where the film becomes rather depressing. Unlike the work of Harry Block that is depressing on the surface, but fun underneath according to one admirer, this film is one that is fun on the surface, but deeply depressing underneath. By the end of the film, it is clear that Allen feels great guilt, but sees no path to redemption for himself because he is not a good person. At the very least, he has his art, but is that really enough if he cannot function like everybody else in the real world? This is a film about a man who does not feel happy or comfortable in his own skin, which is a truly tragic thing to watch unfold. For his part, he dresses it up nicely with comedy, but it cannot hide the truth behind the laughter."" ]";5

With two 20 something guys on the look out for some babies, the film is a fast paced film loaded with great representations of male friendship. With Trent (Vince Vaughn) looking to cheer up his buddy Mikey (Jon Favreau) after the latter recently came to Los Angeles and got out of a six-year relationship, the film is one about bonding, love, and the single life of many men in their 20s. Depicting this friend group bouncing from party to bar to house to club and back again each next, Swingers is a bubbly film with money comedy that does know just how money it really is, but fortunately, that merely adds to its comedic charm."", ""While not uproariously funny at any point, Swingers contributes some solid jokes, largely through Vince Vaughn. With an energetic performance of an **** Vince Vaughn feels like a natural in the role of a guy who is the most popular man in the room wherever he goes. Unfortunately, he is also the saddest character. Unwilling to settle down and with a warped take on women, Trent is a man that may seem popular, but needs the parties and friends in order to not feel painfully alone. This is highlighted at the end when he assumes any girl is flirting with him and when he is drunk and hops on the diner table. He is bubbly and vivacious on the outside, but is no doubt alone and desperately seeking validation. This character is incredibly well-written and I happen to know a few people like this. They are the life of the parties and may go home some hot \""baby\"", but are more alone than the rest of us."", ""As Mikey, Jon Favreau largely plays the audience surrogate into this world of debauchery and drunken fights. Heartbroken over the break-up with his girlfriend, Mikey cannot get over it and just floats with a melancholy attitude throughout the film. Favreau does a great job showing this heartbreak while also showing Mikey's ill-fated attempts to rejoin the dating scene. Feeling incredibly realistic with the neurotic and self-depreciating approach to dating again after having one's heartbroken, Favreau turns the character into a very entertaining comedic foil to the boisterous Vaughn. He also makes him incredibly sympathetic as, much like the women they meet in Vegas, you just want to give the poor guy a hug. That said, Swingers can be incredibly abrasive. The comedy is never incredibly clear and largely just comes through comedic lines or comedic representations of real life people. Every character in this film is authentic and is someone I have seen in real life, except they are dropped into the world of acting in Los Angeles. This adds some show business comedy to the film, but it is largely about some guys who are undoubtedly jerks and their attempts to try and get a woman to come home with them for the night. Thus, it will not be everybody's cup of tea and will put many people off, especially Trent."", ""Swingers is a pretty simple film, but it is enjoyable and easy to like if you go along with its occasionally obnoxious characters. If nothing else, it is a good portrayal of the pain one goes through after having their heart broken and the attempts to get back out there afterwards. Plus, it has a good performance in a good movie from Heather Graham, which is always a rarity. In this film, she honestly looks like a femme fatale from a noir film or a Hitchcock blonde, which makes me wish she had taken a role along those lines at some point. All the same, Swingers is a thinly plotted, but funny film with great turns from Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn."" ]";5

1699;la-story;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Pairing together Steve Martin with his then-wife Victoria Tennant, the Mick Jackson directed L.A. Story delivers a delightfully funny and charming romantic comedy, even if it never quite lives up to many of its aspirations. Written by Steve Martin as a love letter to Los Angeles, but also a critique of the city he loves, L.A. Story really nails this feeling early on before slipping into pure rom-com convention with overwhelming cuteness dominating the underwhelming final act. Until then, however, the film's smart mix of Martin's deadpan humor with observational remarks about the city and its inhabitants, absurdist hyperbole, or simple one-liners really makes for a engaging watch in a well-written comedy. Though the film may come down too safely to really click as an entire film, it nonetheless offers strong enough satire and smart enough commentary on men and women in relationships to come out ahead in the end."", ""Starting off with the farcical and absurdist satire that could be found in a Mel Brooks film or in a Zucker brothers & Abrahams film starring Leslie Nielsen, L.A. Story gets off to a phenomenal start. Introducing us to Harris K. Telemacher (Martin), the film initially positions him as a Nielsen-esque character from Airplane or The Naked Gun. Cutting through homes in his car as he buckles in to get to work as a weatherman, this is a man who initially does not seem to be in on the joke. Later, when he frantically realizes that it is \""open season\"" on the LA freeway and he must defend himself from other drivers with his gun, he continues to be a man that takes things so matter of fact. As increasingly absurd things happen to Harris, he is never frazzled and instead approaches it as a common occurrence in his daily life that is hardly worth paying attention to. When others are shocked, such as Sara (Victoria Tennant) during the earthquake, he continues to be oblivious to the fact that others would find this situation unnatural. Putting Martin in this position is an excellent comedic choice given his skill at delivering deadpan comedic lines. As a comedian, he seems to know how to make people laugh without realizing it was supposed to be funny himself. In the role of Harris, a man who takes himself incredibly seriously despite his laughable job, Martin is a natural."", ""However, the film begins switching gears. It keeps fantastical elements - such as Harris' encounters with the highway signpost - but it switches to be a more run-of-the-mill romantic comedy once SanDeE* (Sarah Jessica Parker) is introduced. Using her to distract himself from his burgeoning romance with Sara, SanDeE* is a bubbly and dumb as rocks young girl who catches Harris' eye for two reasons. Unfortunately, with her introduction, the film quickly settles into turning itself into more of an examination of relationships. Whereas the more absurd first half really zeroed in on smart satire about Los Angeles with comments about the weather, obsession with \""California cuisine\"", nonchalant reactions to earthquakes, and deadly traffic, the film turns around into being a film about an older man with a younger woman. Though some satire remains, such as comments about health freaks via the \""enema date\"" gag, it quickly descends into nothing more than a sanitized romantic comedy with fantastical elements."", ""This is never more apparent than when the film's commentary on men and women being together - men dating women younger than them or feeling jealously about the girl they want sleeping with other men even when they sleep with other women themselves - takes center stage. Ditching the farcical nature of its satire rich first half, this second half winds up playing out like an Albert Brooks film. With romantic commentary, strong comedy, and a character just trying to make sense of it all, L.A. Story likes the comedic punch of a Brooks film in these moments, but it nonetheless bears similarities with Brooks' work, especially Modern Romance. Though Martin is not nearly as neurotic, the jealousy and agony based commentary set against the backdrop of Los Angeles and the insanity of life there makes for an easy comparison."", ""However, perhaps the most apt comparison for L.A. Story is the work of Woody Allen. Known for both fantastical plots and romantic comedies, L.A. Story feels like a film Allen would have made if it were set in New York City and featured a more neurotic protagonist. Though its visual gags are more slapstick and akin to early Allen, the film eventually settles into the nice fantasy romantic comedy shtick that Allen has perfected the formula for. With quick and witty one-liners, observational comedy, and some practically divine intervention interrupting the proceedings, the film packs the same frenetic and chaotic style of Allen sans the misanthropic philosophy."" ]";5

However, John Cusack always finds a way to feel endlessly relatable, especially here in a film about a hitman returning home to go to his 10-year high school reunion. As someone who is nearly halfway there on that front, there is a terrifying idea made even more awkward by him being a contract killer. The film is unapologetically fun and really plants a smile on your face from beginning to end. Even more, it does a great job humanizing hitmen while taking a comedic approach to both that subject and returning home after many years. That said, the plot can be a little convenient and unfulfilling, namely in the sense that they keep emphasizing one point and then it is rectified in two seconds. The film's romantic element is also not given enough depth or room to breath. It feels like a very cliche movie romance. The film's incessant cleverness and unique take feels super Pulp Fiction (helped by the cardboard cutout of it during a shootout) and it feels like the kind of film made in the aftermath of it that thought, \""Oh wow that looked fun, let's do it again\"". While still a fun movie, the incessant cleverness and alleged contemplation on the part of our protagonist can be a little much at times. However, that being said, it is a very well acted and well-written flick that entertains in spades while also providing an interesting look at someone returning home after many years."" ]";5
1701;cabaret;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""After not liking All That Jazz, my expectations for Cabaret were realistic. I knew that it was possible Bob Fosse's directing style was simply not something I was programmed to enjoy. The end result is a film that seems inconclusive. Definitely more up my alley than All That Jazz, Cabaret is still not a film I would quite say I liked. More-or-less, it is an above average musical (in my books) that has some positives and some drawbacks that leave it being a pretty muddled and mixed bag at the end of the day."", ""First, the negatives. Though La La Land has come under fire for its weak or bad singing from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, it is abundantly clear to myself that both Stone and Gosling turn in better singing performances than Liza Minnelli and especially Joel Grey in Cabaret. Neither impress, instead turning in bland performances of bland songs such as \""Money, Money\"" or \""Two Ladies\"" (for Grey). Yes, both are legends - especially Minnelli - but neither really struck me as being worthy of the praise they receive for this film on the singing side of things. Minnelli is largely ineffectual and lacks the punch needed for these musical numbers, instead just feeling quite robotic and missing the gravitas necessary to pull of the songs. Fortunately for her, this is not all her fault as some of the song performed in the cabaret are just very bad. Some have great lyrics and melodies, other are just overtly risque for no other value. The former are exclusively songs with Minnelli. The latter are reserved for Grey who is just flat-out grating to watch. He is too exuberant and boisterous. His singing is comically bad throughout and seems to be played out for laughs with his weird lip movements than for any actual singing ability. If people say Gosling is bad in La La Land, then Grey needs his due for being a bad singer in Cabaret. By the end of the film, however, my favorite song was the one not including either of them and given that they were the stars and the main attractions on the musical side, this seems quite alarming."", ""Second, the editing is quite bad. Just as in All That Jazz, Fosse goes cut happy at points. Jumping rapidly from one image to the next, the film just turns into a blur at parts. While it is supposed to represent the speed at which everything is occurring, it unfortunately has the side effect of rendering those moments entirely unwatchable and distracting. All That Jazz had the same issue with these rapid cuts that distract more than they enhance. It is clearly a style employed by Fosse that simply does not work in my view. While not too plentiful, the moments are bad enough and occur often enough to be worth mentioning. Other than these, the editing is fine. Nothing great and nothing awful. It cuts when it should and is quite cohesive as a final product, but those few moments unfortunately leave a lot to be desired."", ""In the mixed, not a pro and not a con, section we have the film's sexuality. Openly confronting society's reservations about open sexuality, LGBT persons, and various other sexual taboos, Cabaret is a crucially important film. It shows that those who cross dress, are trans, are gay, are bi, or are lesbians, are just people too. They want to have fun, they cry, they want to love, and they want to laugh all the same. Cabaret, for this, is boundary shattering. It is impressively open about these topics to the point that it may be too much. Mind you, I am not saying it is too risque or that I am a prude. Rather, it feels as though the film tries too hard to push these boundaries. It includes so many topics and, by the end, it feels like the film is just sitting there and judging the audience for not accepting like one of those SNL sketches about high school theatre with the film screaming out, \""This is normal and your world view is small.\"" While I agree with its message of acceptance against its backdrop of the rise in Nazism, it feels like it pours it on a bit thick."", ""On the positive side of things, some songs really stand out. Though I criticized Minnelli and Grey before, allow me to walk some of those comments back in praising some of their songs. For Grey, \""If You Could See Her\"" is beautifully sung, catchy, and incredibly entertaining. It is also thematically relevant with a great take on accepting a person for who they are and not just judging a book by its cover. For Minnelli, \""Mein Herr\"" and \""Maybe This Time\"" are real standouts. The former features solid singing, but tremendous choreography by Fosse. The latter is gorgeously written with a great mournful and longing delivery by Minnelli on the vocal side of things. Yet, bar none, the highlight of the film is \""Tomorrow Belongs to Me\"". Absolutely chilling to watch be sung by a boy in a Nazi uniform and joined in by similar white people, the sequence is brilliantly put together by Fosse and haunting. The singing and lyrics are terrific, but the moment it signifies is the real highlight and shows the perfect blend of music"" ]";5

There is a separation of church and state, so to speak. The thrilling scenes are reserved for thrills. The in-between and build-up can have sprinkles of comedy, but the scenes that imitate Alien are preserved solely for that. And what an imitation it can be (obviously it imitates more than Alien). At times, it left me jumping in my seat trying to get people to run quicker. Underwood creates terrific tension that certainly can place you firmly on the edge of your seat, while also delivering solid action sequences of the town taking on the worms. Though it can be quite silly in this regard, their plans do make sense and could certainly be used if people found themselves in this situation. That said, the plans do feel as if they were taken right out of a 1950s creature feature."", """", ""Though the romance is a bit forced, Tremors does have good character development, even if it is the classic \""immature man turned into a hero/mature by a woman he loves that forces him to change his outlook on life\"" trope. The characters, even if cookie cutter, are incredibly likeable and rope you into really enjoying the film as you watch their antics and root for them to escape the clutches of the worm. As for the worm, the approach to the creature is really cool and well done. With reasonable traits that it always stays within, the worms are actually really interesting creatures to watch in the film due to the realistic and borderline scientific approach taken to helping us understand what these beasts are and how they behave."", """", ""Overall, Tremors is cheesy and filled with one-liners. However, the cheese is gooey goodness and the one-liners hit. Plus, they are expertly balanced with true moments of suspense, thrills, and horror by director Ron Underwood who capably keeps the atmosphere and balance of the film while juggling many different genres. Taking inspiration from 1950s creature features, as well as well many 1980s and 1990s science fiction, horror, and action films, Tremors still finds ways to feel fresh and entertaining in spite of the consistent feeling that you had seen this film before."" ]";5

The cast had great chemistry with one another and though the characters, plot, and film are absolutely the dumbest I have seen in a while, the energy and aesthetic of the film are undeniably infectious. James Franco turns in a characteristically charismatic performance and really steals the show as a drug dealer who is absolutely hysterical. He has phenomenal one-liners and comedic timing that leave you in stitches repeatedly, though the cast does. I never expected to actually come away liking this film. Yet, here I am.

Directed and conceptualized by Sam Raimi, the film is well-written and well-plotted and does a great job siding you with Neeson's character, Darkman. As a superhero film, it plays out largely as it would in a comic and shows Raimi's willingness to adapt his original character to the conventions of the genre. While the special effects do hold the film back, the heartfelt and very well designed character and make-up effects do make up for that negative. Plus, the film is so well-directed by Sam Raimi's sure hand that it is nearly impossible to not enjoy this.

1707;mimic;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Last year, Hooptober started for me with Guillermo del Toro's Cronos. Starting off this year with his follow-up to that film and his first English-language work, Mimic, was an easy decision. Unfortunately, Mimic is just alright. Clearly interfered with by Harvey Weinstein and his meddlesome minions at Miramax to make it more commerical, Del Toro's Mimic is perhaps his most conventional plot, his most scattershot, and perhaps his most cliche. Yet, all of this comes underneath the surface of a truly visually stunning work that matches the heights of Del Toro's filmography with pure visual splendor. Matching it with great sound work and creature effects, Mimic is a film with so many great parts that it is crushing to realize that it is truly nothing special, even if its surface details hint at a truly great semi-modern creature feature."", ""Dimly lit at all times with the characters trekking about in the darkness of their labs, homes, or the New York City transit system, Mimic benefits greatly from Del Toro's ominous visual style. Playing out like a gothic horror film with stone walls and ominous dark corners lurking about, Mimic may be a modern film but its old-age stylings contribute to it being a truly haunting film visually. In terms of visual appeal, the darkness contributes to shots akin to The Third Man as they trek out of the dimly lit outside world into a dark tunnel holding unknown creatures. With light poking in from the outside that does very little to alleviate the darkness of the room, Del Toro manages to turn Mimic into one of those horror films that keeps the audience consistently in the dark as to what is occurring due to, literally, how dark the screen is at all times. This creepy production design keeps the audience guessing as to what could be around the corner and with the creatures constantly shrouded in darkness, it is never easy to decipher exactly what is going on."", ""Alongside this fantastic production design, Mimic features a great use of sound throughout. With a menacing score present in all thrilling moments that really sets the tone perfectly, Del Toro keeps the audience on edge through other non-score sound effects. With clicking and the banging together of spoons, Mimic is one that is littered with little pitter-pattering of large bug feet walking about around the subway system. Able to keep the viewer constantly on edge with these ominous noises floating about, Del Toro is often able to scare us solely through suggestion. The chief example of this is when entomologist Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) is walking around on the subway platform. Seeing what she thought was a man and asking him for the time only to realize it is a bug, she starts to run away. Stopping to scan the situation, Del Toro uses a high and tight close-up of Sorvino as she looks around with a panicked look on her face. Suddenly, the subway rips by with a violently loud sound. Throwing the viewer right off the edge of their seat, Del Toro does not deliver this fright by showing her confront the bug, but rather through some peripheral sound that is not scary without the requisite atmosphere. With the fantastic production and sound design, Mimic is a film with the perfect atmosphere to pull off such a scare."", ""However, where the film falters is towards the end. Banding together to fight off the creatures they had created to fight off diseased cockroaches that were making children sick years earlier, Susan and a team of three others must sacrifice life and limb to kill these monstrosities. With a cliche-ridden final act as the group face off, needlessly sacrifice themselves, setting up a \""final girl\"", and then tearjerkingly reuniting the lovers involved in this conflict, Mimic ends rather safely. Given that everything in the film was caused by Susan trying to play God, one could not be blamed for assuming that she would face some consequence for this. However, Mimic cheapens out, makes her the hero, and gives her the emotional send-off requisite of an action hero. Toss in a very convenient malfunction and fixing of a lighter to literally blow up the subway system in New York City that does not kill the one who starts the explosion and it is hard to really support Mimic as a good film. For a film from Del Toro, it seems so cliche, safe, predictable, and conveniently plotted, that it is hard to not see the fingerprints of Weinstein all over the film's final act."", ""Beautifully put together with great attention to the set design and the sound design, but with useless characterizations, often iffy acting (Mira Sorvino yelling at the creature to come get her instead of the annoying child really sends chills down your spine due to how horribly she delivered the line), and a dreadfully safe final act, Mimic is simply a mixed bag. It is no surprise that Del Toro came back after a Spanish-language film after this one due to how his vision of this film was standardized and sterilized by Hollywood."" ]";5
1708;they-live;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Characterized as an allegory for Jewish control of the media by neo-nazis, it is borderline comical to see how such great art has been misinterpreted. Guess that is what happens to those of us who are a few cards away from a full deck. As it stands, the film is truly just an inventive alien invasion flick that doubles as a social critique for how people sit back and do not question what they are told. This, again, is a problem that continues to today where people simply read or hear something and take it as the gospel truth because the person is on the news or sounds like they know what they are saying. They Live is a cautionary tale in this regard as people have been lulled into believing they are safe when, in reality, we are blind to the negative forces all around us that corrupt our minds. In John Carpenter's incredibly inventive and imaginative They Live, those negative forces are aliens."", ""Unaware of what is going on until he puts on some special sunglasses, John Nada (Roddy Piper) quickly sets out to help the resistance expose the control the aliens have achieved. Through cool gadgets such as those sunglasses of the aliens' watches, the film creates some great little science fiction touches that really only add to the experience. In particular, the former creates incredible anxiety. As John gets surrounded by aliens that know he can see, the film takes on an incredibly thrilling and terrifying tone. However, the same can be said for when he has the glasses off. Whenever he is in a tough situation and Carpenter does not immediately have him put on the glasses, the film is packed with tension and paranoia. The film manages to convince you that everybody and anybody could be an alien, especially when he lacks the glasses. When he loses them, the tension and anxiety to put them back on is felt by the audience as our heart races along with John's."", ""Action-wise, the film is incredibly strong. Each action set piece is incredibly strong and Carpenter knows his way around a gun battle. This is very much the case in They Live in which his battles are very similar to ones found in the very beginning of his career, except with more polish and better effects. On that note, the visual effects are very good. The film does a great job crafting the look the aliens and it feels like it is very similar in style in that area to Tim Burton's Mars Attacks!. However, it feels realistic and looks funny at the very least. Carpenter plays on this at the end when the aliens are revealed in bars, having sex, or on television. While comical in look and feel, the aliens do look pretty interesting and feel authentic and an interesting take on what aliens would like and do on earth."", ""They Live could also be categorized as Carpenter being very tongue-in-cheek with his fighting against criticisms towards his use of sex and violence. The ending highlights this with an alien on television saying that he and George Romero need to tone down both. Here, Carpenter essentially compares his critics to being mindless robotic aliens, incapable of formulating their own opinions. Instead, they opt to parrot what they have heard others say. This is unfortunately still prevalent today, especially in film criticism when a popular film or artist's reputation is quickly torn apart after one critic or person makes a short-sighted argument, which then gains steam and popularity. Carpenter had obviously been critiqued for both sex and violence, so he answers with a film built on testosterone and campy violence and action. Honestly, it is admirable to see him fight back in this fashion."", ""They Live is a truly entertaining and campy science fiction horror comedy about a man who wakes up to alien invasion taking place on Earth. While silly, its science fiction pieces are imaginative and truly engaging. It creates a world that is worthy of further looks and is truly fun to imagine the possibilities within this world, especially with the cool knick knacks introduced by Carpenter throughout the film. Action-packed, inventive, and simply a good time, They Live is another top-notch film from John Carpenter."" ]";5

However, it is an incredibly smart film that aces its satirical goals. The acting is bad, the nudity is unnecessary, and the gore is excessive, but it is fun and has some great special effects. The satirical element, as I said, is great. It really skewers the military industrial complex of our country and the blind loyalty we have towards the military. Honestly, it is not hard to draw comparisons between the depicted conflict and the ones we currently find ourselves in. Thus, no matter how loud and juvenile it can be, this fantastic satire truly elevates it multiple levels for me. Plus, as I said, Paul Verhoeven's films are a guilty pleasure of mine at this point.

Now, in terms of films on addiction, this one is much lighter than a film such as Requiem for a Dream and easier to get through for sure (though I do prefer Requiem for a Dream to this one). This \""lightness\"" is thanks to good dark comedy elements and the hopefulness you feel for a better future at different times during the film. However, that does not mean this one is not dark as there are many scenes that are extremely haunting and really make you feel one with the characters as they went through these situations. Ewan McGregor is great in this film, though really the entire cast is phenomenal as everybody pulls their weight equally. Danny Boyle's direction is frenetic and fabolous. In addition, the script is awesome. Every line is dripping with quality.

1712;the-manchurian-candidate-1962;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Remade by Jonathan Demme in 2004, John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate is often cited as the classic to Demme's average remake. Personally, I find the original to only be slightly better than its re-do, perhaps because the cast of that film just worked so well in their respective roles. Regardless, Frankenheimer's film is undoubtedly a strong work that is laced with communist paranoia, great acting, and possesses an unpredictability throughout that allows for a truly explosive ending. Though its slow pace allows some issues such as its sometimes iffy characters and rushed plotting to bubble up to the surface quite readily, The Manchurian Candidate remains a terrifying and entertaining political thriller that is still rather relevant today."", ""This communist paranoia is often what led to such brilliant films of the era, but usually it is just derived from the monolithic Soviet Union. Here, Frankenheimer focuses on the red scare at home and abroad. With an American man, thought to be a hero, being controlled by the communists for their own political gain, the scene is set for the fear of the communists to come to life. Abroad, the Chinese are equally a part of this with the North Koreans and Russians also having a hand. It is the entire communist bloc of the east that has united to take on the American political system. It is terrifying, deadly, and a stroke of genius to have one of our own do the infiltration they desperately need to do. At home, Senator John Iselin (James Gregory) practices a brand of McCarthyism where he just wildly accuses everybody of being a communist party member and calls his political opponents communists. All of his moves are dictated by his wife Mrs. Iselin (Angela Lansbury). The poor people have no idea that his stepson, Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), is the man being controlled by the communists. Setting the atmosphere right with this irony between Iselin's rhetoric and the fact that the his own stepson is a tool for the commies, Frankenheimer's film has rampant paranoia coursing through its veins that constantly keeps the audience on edge. Who is a commie? Who is a commie tool? Are there any commies?"", ""Yet, what is interesting is how the film opts to damn both the communists and the hysterics in America. While the Communists are naturally the antagonists in the film for how they try and assassinate a political candidate by brainwashing another man, the film shows both Mrs. Iselin and John Iselin as being frauds concerned with power. Neither actually believe the nonsense John spews, but he is made to spout it all because it is good for him to do so politically. The film, essentially, turns this duo into the antagonists for their manipulation of the American people to becoming a fearful bunch just waiting to see who could possibly be a Soviet operative hiding in plain sight. Through both the writing and actions on-screen, Frankenheimer assures the audience that the Communists are not the only bad ones here: the politicians that made their name fearmongering are just as bad."", ""What makes the film most impactful, however, is its unpredictability. From reveals about who is and who is not a Soviet operative to the thrilling climax, The Manchurian Candidate is a thoroughly unpredictable film, even for those who have seen the original. It is a film that constantly keeps the audience on edge and awaiting what comes next because throughout, Frankenheimer proves that what we see is not always true. Introducing this concept when we first see Maj. Bennett Marco's (Frank Sinatra) dreams, the film constantly calls our attention to the fact that this dream may not be a dream and, even if it is, where did it come from? A terrifying concept about memory implantation that throws into disarray everything we know up to that point, Frankenheimer keeps working his magic throughout, never really allowing the audience to settle in and figure out exactly what is coming next."", ""That is not to say the film is not flawed, however. Though the acting is strong across the board from Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, and Angela Lansbury, the film's writing of some characters can often struggle. For example, poor Janet Leigh is stranded in a nothing role as a woman who Marco meets on a train. She does well in the role that is more than a girlfriend role due to the odd conversation she has with him on the train that hints at the possibility of her being a Communist operative herself, but the film hardly does anything about it. If she is a Communist operative, she is not a very good one as Marco continues to pursue Shaw anyways. If she is not, then that is just the weirdest and most out-of-left-field conversation in the history of film. Regardless, her character is largely left flapping in the wind to do nothing but allow us to realize that Communists could be anybody or that person could just be a bit different. It is a true personification of that paranoia"" ]";5

Charles Grodin is also quite good here and his chemistry with De Niro is noticeably great, which really adds to the comedy. In addition, the plot, though outlandish and very unlikely, is interesting to follow. For an action comedy, this one certainly feels relatively familiar and though it has many stupid action sequences that are a must for action films with explosions and shootouts that are highly improbable, coupled with actions that are completely unlikely, I still enjoyed it. Maybe because, even though it had some of those elements, it did not dominate the picture, which largely focused on the relationship between De Niro and Grodin, which was refreshing. It was also oddly touching at times, though it certainly tried to steer clear of being sappy. For the most part, this one has not really shown its age (though it looks very 80's, it still works today) and the comedy translates well. The script is also solid . Though outlandish as I said before, everything really clicks with the dialogue and comedy. Enjoyable little film that is not great, but is pretty good."" ]";5

Wondrously crafted and bold in scope, The English Patient may not be truly brilliant, but director Anthony Minghella certainly did a fantastic job. However, I will say I never found this one too romantic. People gush about how romantic it is, but it is simply about two scumbags who wind up having sex with one another. Maybe I am just jaded and have extra hatred for cheaters, but anyways. Ralph Fiennes is fantastic, as are Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Kristin Scott Thomas, Naveen Andrews, and Colin Firth. Though I did not find the love story to be charming or romantic, the story told by Fiennes' character is still incredibly moving and full of human drama. The romantic part of the film, to me, would be aimed at the desert, which is beautifully captured at both its best and its worst. A captivating World War II romantic drama, The English Patient is quite long and could stand to be shorter, nor it is particularly impactful, but it remains a beautiful film that does not deserve the negative impression I had going in."" ]";5

In a sign of things to come, the film uses an ensemble cast to great effect with phenomenal performances from Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C.

The comedy is well timed (a lot of it thanks to the kids in the film) and light. Overall, there is not much to say about this one.

Though these people may not be the best human beings ever (in particular Cage's character), you get a sense that there is more to both of them and that they absolutely need one another. A very interesting character study and an interesting look at the seedier parts of Las Vegas, this one does have its negatives. Namely the fact that it can drag a bit. While riveting and a very interesting example of how a film just needs characters, not necessarily a plot to make it successful, this one does slow down at times, which is what made me not enjoy it as much as others.

His performance as the mentally slow Karl stands tall though as the best thing about this film, though the performances of everyone else here are also top-of-the-line. The characters are perfectly put together and their relationships feels entirely authentic. The film also feels incredibly Southern, which gives it a great authenticity on that front.

Detailing the demise of the Delta house on the campus of Faber College through their constant antics, Animal House is a consistently funny, irreverent, and over-the-top comedy. Featuring an ensemble cast, the film relies upon the charisma of its cast, the ludicrous situations they find themselves in, and their propensity to throw impromptu parties at the drop of a hat. While hardly a major cinematic achievement, Animal House is simply easy, breezy fun."", ""A sexed up drunk film, Animal House's ensemble cast provides the film with serious charisma. In particular, John Belushi obviously steals the show as the stupid John Blutarsky. An alcoholic who only suggests the stupidest ideas, Blutarsky is the life of the party and Belushi provides this spark throughout the film. From the cafeteria to the frat house to the homecoming parade, Blutarsky has a lot of fun and is undoubtedly the dumbest person shown in this film. However, I have one question: How did those sorority girls not see him watching them from outside their window? He literally made eye contact with them all. As for the other characters, Boon (Peter Riegert), Otter (Tim Matheson), and Larry Kroger (Thomas Hulce), are all incredibly lovable and provide great moments of comedy throughout the film. The writing is also very good as they manage to craft memorable characters. They may all look similar and act similar, but the film manages to create distinctions between all of its players, which allows the audience to begin to sympathize with members of the fraternities and the unfortunate women who find themselves in these houses. All of the characters may be pretty one-dimensional, but that is a by-product and showing so many different people. Fortunately, each character has their own energy and contribution to the film with each of their side stories being largely well-developed enough to create empathy and intrigue along the way."", ""Comedically, Animal House is certainly quite dated. Many of the jokes still land with no problem, however, with the film often overflowing with hilariously over-the-top gags. It may take it too far in the homecoming sequence, but otherwise, its simple, stupid, and irreverent humor works and is incredibly effective in eliciting laughs. Now, of course, a lot of jokes do not land and this is largely a result of the film being 38 years old. What was funny then may not be exactly funny now and, plus, a lot of the plotting is pretty well covered nowadays. Yet, it is quite cliche for back then even with the stereotypically evil and out-of-touch dean who - gasp - does not want dead horses in his office. While that scene is quite funny, it is not hard to imagine why Delta is the thorn in the dean's side, even if you ignore the fact that Otter sleeps with the dean's wife. A classic comedy, Animal House is still incredibly funny and a great time, even if quite dated by now. Without a large ensemble cast that make the antics seem almost wholesome, Animal House never offends, as all of its jokes are simply too dumb to be taken truly seriously. That said, its portrayal of college is still certainly very true, as frats just never change. The film is a bit over-the-top in its portrayal, but at its core - depicting the frat guys as nothing but alcoholic sex addicts - still rings true and I imagine it will forever be the case."" ]";5

F. Murray Abraham is great as Mozart's jealous rival Salieri, but to me, the real star here was Elizabeth Berridge, who plays Mozart's wife. In an innocent, vulnerable, strong, and entirely powerful performance, she manages to keep Mozart focused and keep him grounded, while also doing the same for the viewer. She is marvelous here and turns in an entirely enchanting performance. Tom Hulce, who plays Mozart, does well, but his performance is incredibly over the top and that proves to be a bit annoying at times. In no surprise, the music in the film is truly incredible and enrapturing. The production design and costume design are also top of the line. Finally, the direction from Milos Forman is grand in scale and phenomenal. This one was told quite well and really worked on multiple levels.

The characters were well crafted and their arcs very interesting to follow. There were a lot of them, sure, but it was never too overwhelming. In addition, the true story aspect of this made the story really work and I can see why Scorsese was drawn to this, as it feels like a very Scorsese film, as thematically it is similar to many of his other works. For the most part, it felt a bit like Goodfellas in a casino, but I did not really mind that. The only thing that really stuck out to me was the narration.

While the blood and violence can certainly be excessive, it has the comic feel to it that dulls the blow, thankfully. On top of that, the acting is great, especially Al Pacino. His accent may be a little much, but it really works with every over the top element here. The direction from Brian De Palma is also very strong. I honestly think this was the perfect project for him and he did a great job with it. The writing from Oliver Stone is also great and endlessly quotable. It is not hard to see how this one has such a long-lasting life after its release considering how quotable and enjoyable it is. Luckily, it is also expertly made.

With all of the classic characters from Bram Stoker's Dracula popping up throughout this film, Coppola's bloody descent into the very depths of hell set in Transylvania is one that lingers in the air like a dense, blue or green fog. Chilling to one's very soul, Coppola's take on Dracula may be infamous for the poor acting of Keanu Reeves, but it is so much more than anticipated."", ""With Gary Oldman portraying the titular monster, Coppola's take on Dracula is one laced with menace from the very beginning. Sinister, morose, and sadistic, images of Dracula's demonic horde of women seducing Keanu Reeves' Jon Harker or consuming a baby for strength are seared into the very fabric of this film. However, comes after revealing what has sent Dracula into this hellish descent into sin with Satan as his tour guide. Renouncing God and stabbing a crucifix after learning that his enemies had deceived his bride Elisabeth (Winona Ryder) into believing he was dead, which caused her to kill herself, Dracula turns his back on the Lord rather violently and becomes a vampire. Capturing souls for Satan via the seduction of spiritually vulnerable women such as Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost), Dracula's discovery that Jonathan is set to marry Mina (Winona Ryder) who is a spitting image of Elisabeta is one that sets him on a course for London. Roping her into his world of sin and evil, Dracula is a man who is intent on mending his broken heart and delves into sin, immortality, and violence, as a method of soothing this ache in his now-dead soul. A shockingly tragic figure who, along with his minions, commits abhorrent violence, Dracula is a man who instills fear into the hearts of all those who hear of him and his ways. Yet, through his anguish, he becomes a man who is sympathetic in the sense that he was once a force for good who, through loss, let his soul and sword be used a weapon of Satan."", ""It is through this that the film's demonic exploits work in spite of the controversy surrounding them and why the film's \""love conquers all\"" finale is so powerful. Tempting and using sin as a weapon against their targets, Coppola shows the bare-breasted demonic concubines seducing Jonathan by sliding through his spread legs and presenting themselves for his pleasure. Seducing him into lusting after them and committing a sin of the flesh, the women secure Jonathan's soul via this method. The disorienting camera work from Coppola and the decision to end the scene by showing the women swarm around a baby to drink its blood make the scene one that sends chills throughout the viewer's entire being. Yet, together with the characterization of Lucy as a sinful, worldly, and intensely sexual seductress of the men in her life, the film demonstrates the path by which one's soul is corrupted. Giving into this temptation leaves them open to sin, one which Lucy fully embraces and one that Jonathan stands strong and resists."", ""This descent into hell and corruption of good is demonstrated in Mina as well. At the beginning, she is envious of Lucy. Well-mannered, strict, and hardly a seductress, Mina is shocked to see nude images in a copy of Arabian Nights. When Lucy sees these images, however, she explains to Mina what is going on, giggles, and puts deviously sexual thoughts into Mina's head and expresses her own. Planting these seeds of sin, Mina is set up perfectly for the arrival of Dracula. Unleashing her inner sexual being, he gives her the carnal pleasure she so desires in the scene in which he takes turns her into a vampire. With Jonathan - her husband - unwilling to go into such sexuality even with his wife, she turns to Dracula as the only possible source of this pleasure and the one who makes her feel most in touch with her most forbidden desires. Demonstrating the immediate ecstasy and pleasure garnered from giving into temptation, Dracula quickly shows the downside with Mina expressing immediate regret and guilt over her sin when she collapses into Jonathan's arms after Dracula leaves."", ""It is through this necessary hellish descent into sin that Coppola expresses the soul of Dracula. A torn, broken, and hideously sinful man, he resents God so he corrupts those that would belong to Him. Putting sin, lust, and deceit, into their hearts due to the wrongs that he perceives to have been done to him, Dracula brings the hellish hurt and anguish of his soul onto the Earth in order to spread the pain, hunger, and forbidden lust that he feels in his soul. He is a man who cannot suffer"" ]";5
1724;the-fifth-element;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A wonderfully crafted and truly entertaining science fiction film, The Fifth Element has a fantastic message about the true source of power in the world and how it stands compared to true evil. Even better, it has a great message about violence and evil and how evil begets evil. This is truly where The Fifth Element's success largely comes from, though the performances of Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich are both very, very good. The special effects are pretty cool and slick, as is the script and the direction from Luc Besson. Even better, the world it created is a fun and very expansive one that would be great to see more of. However, what I believe holds this one back a bit is the bad villain. Not only are there many of them, but Gary Oldman's motivations are never fully explained. His character is poorly developed and this really harms the overall film. However, that being said, The Fifth Element is a fantastic time and a very well done science fiction action film that is endlessly watchable."" ]";5
1725;the-witches-of-eastwick;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The Witches of Eastwick is a natural follow-up to the Mad Max series for director George Miller. I mean, what else was a man who directed a trilogy of gritty Australian action movies expected to make? This New England set suburban fantasy horror comedy focuses on three women. Divorced, deserted, or widowed, from their husbands, the trio of Jane (Susan Sarandon), Sukie (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Alexandra (Cher) are lonely and occupy their time by hanging out with one another and their kids. In other words, they have no lives left whatsoever beyond discussing how they hate men and desperately want to meet the perfect guy. In steps the mysterious Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson). Bewitchingly devilish, Daryl manages to rope in these three women and successfully seduces all of them, turning them into his little sex slaves. A comedy for the whole family, The Witches of Eastwick is a battle of the sexes for the ages."", ""Throughout this film, men are really criticized. Even Daryl gets in on the action, lamenting how men kill women in marriage by squeezing out every bit of life in them, arguing that men keep women oppressed due to their own self-consciousness over penis size and power, and believing that women blossom once they ditch the men in their life. For the trio of witches/women, they whole-heartedly agree and see men as slick, repulsive, arrogant, and selfish. Yet, they cannot help themselves. Once they hear Daryl say he wants them, even if they would normally say no and do not find him attractive, they give in to his every whim. On the other hand, Daryl goes from praising women for their ability to give birth and produce milk to ripping them apart as nothing but a mistake and curse from God. After giving them so much, he is baffled as to how they could now reject him. How could they want more? He has already given them the world and powers previously inconceivable! Why are these women so unsatisfied?"", ""However, the truth lies in the relationship between men and women. Unless you are gay, the fact that men and women do not work together at times yet desperately need one another at all times will personally impact your life. Even then, you may hear friends in relationships lament about how awful their mate is, yet then express love for them to the next day. This \""cannot live with them, cannot live without them\"" element is very much the status quo at times. Going from loving to being annoyed, The Witches of Eastwick oddly enough perfectly exemplifies this turbulent relationship, though shown between witches and the devil himself. If nothing else, it shows that nobody is immune from the strife that arises between two vastly different people coming to live with one another and build a life together as a single entity. This on-again and off-again relationship is one also shown by Clyde (Richard Jenkins) and wife Felicia (Veronica Cartwright) once she breaks her leg and becomes a tool for the devil to punish her incessant warnings about Daryl's home. Annoyed with her, Clyde is nonetheless beholden to her - as he rips his own reporter, Sukie, in a story about Daryl after Felicia begged him to do so - and annoyed with her - as he works the fire and gets some nefarious ideas and actions regarding his now grating wife. Yet, these extremes of sacrificing everything to sometimes wanting to ring their neck (not literally) is what defines the relationship between men and women. In The Witches of Eastwick, Miller showcases just how challenging it can be, especially when it is three women versus one man."", ""Furthermore, the film often exemplifies the ideas of Laura Mulvey. To Mulvey, women in film have two roles. One, that of child-rearer. Second, as castrator due to their incessant penis envy. For the former, the film shows them all get pregnant or be mothers with Daryl lauding women's ability to get pregnant and carry a child to term. For the latter, the women frequently talk about the size of men's penises and what they would prefer only to later give Daryl's voodoo doll a very noticeable member. Often **** these women - especially as they seduce Daryl later in the film - The Witches of Eastwick is a film that is all about penises. Men have them. Women do not. Men are protective and self-conscious. Women want them. Why? Penises represent power. Men must shield theirs and push women down to ensure that they can keep the power. Women want the power and will come straight for the jugular to get this power. By the time the women take down Daryl, we see his shriveled body and later see him as just a head on a television set where the women have the remote to shut him off. Losing his penis, and thus his power, Daryl is now beholden to the whim of these women as they have, effectively, castrated him while nonetheless giving birth to his children. Exemplifying this role of castrator and child-rearer, these women are ones who want the power and will stop at nothing to take it all from Daryl."" ]";5
1726;the-year-of-living-dangerously;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""As a filmmaker, Peter Weir is known for making slow and contemplative films that one could categorize as a sort of mood/tone piece, while being wholly aesthetic-driven. Capturing the gorgeous surroundings of his characters and always dropping his protagonists into deeply traumatic situations that force them to assess who they are, what they are, and how they will respond to this unique experience, it is no surprise that Weir's films many times wind up focusing on a character outside of their comfort zone. In Picnic at Hanging Rock, everybody is thrust into discomfort when girls go missing in the beautiful Australian brush. In Witness, Harrison Ford plays a big city cop sent to Amish country, which is practically a foreign land to him. The Mosquito Coast finds Ford and his family in the middle of nowhere trying to build a new society. Dead Poets Society dumps Robert Sean Leonard into an all-boys school that is dated and a father who hates his acting loving son. Fearless finds Jeff Bridges in a plane crash that forces a full re-evaluation of life. The Truman Show pulls the curtain back on Jim Carrey's false life. Russell Crowe is forced to cope with the seas in Master and Commander. The men and women in The Way Back must traverse mountains, deserts, and freezing temperatures to get back home from Siberia. Encapsulating various life experiences that finds everybody from every walk of life covered in his filmography, Weir's film nonetheless share commonality beyond just dumping characters into truly adverse life and environmental conditions."", ""This commonality is largely found in the singular truth about the world: life will be challenging, but how one responds to those challenges is what defines them as a person. In The Year of Living Dangerously, Mel Gibson stars as journalist Guy Hamilton. Sent to Indonesia, a country at the brink of civil war between the dictator and the communists, he is tasked with covering the events from the capital for the Australian Broadcasting Services. While there he befriends an Indonesian photographer named Billy Kwan (Linda Hunt), meets other journalists, and forges a romance with British diplomat Jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver). Along the way, he sees people cope with the struggles of living in a brutal dictatorship with children dying from disease and people starving in the streets. There are beggars on every corner and no Indonesian is truly spared from the horror of poverty and starvation. Relying upon Tolstoy to focus the audience's attention on what truly matters here, Weir poses the question to the characters and the audience, \""What then must we do?\"""", ""Everybody in the film responds differently and it winds up being how they are defined as people. Initially using the impending war to build his own career and benefit himself, Guy Hamilton disappoints Billy by not using his position as a journalist to save the Indonesian people by calling to attention their need for humanitarian help. When Jill gives him a tip about the impending civil war, he broadcasts it without her permission. He discards his duty to the Indonesian people consistently in favor of reporting news. Billy, meanwhile, sees the horrors going around him in his own country and decides to take matters into his own hands by protesting the dictator with a sign hanging out of his hotel window. It does not work, but he nonetheless stepped up to the plate when needed. In essence, both answer Tolstoy's question differently. To the question of \""What then must we do?\"", Guy agrees with Tolstoy. Weir calls this out in a conversation between Guy and Billy, in which Billy says exactly that: Guy agrees with Tolstoy. There is nothing to do, for it will just get lost in the shuffle. There are larger issues at play that cannot be ignored and these people, even if given a meal now, will just starve tomorrow instead. It is a hopeless endeavor to try and rescue them without solving the issues that put them in that situation initially. For Billy, however, he disagrees with Tolstoy. He donates money and time to a woman and her ailing son, while taking political stands against the government towards the end when the former does not work. He believes in doing whatever he can to help the people right now without relying upon the slow, but long, arm of foreign justice as is the case with Guy."", ""Yet, while the film's a largely compelling and engaging watch, it nonetheless feels too much like a Casablanca wannabe. As some critics have pointed out, Weir was clearly inspired by Michael Curtiz' master work, but unfortunately, The Year of Living Dangerously is harmed by this fact. Tossing in an ineffectual and useless romance with Jill Bryant to the equation, the film winds up feeling too distracted. It smartly tells its story of Indonesia and the awful prostitute-loving foreign press, as well as developing its central theme about how to respond to such horror, but it splits its time with the love interest."" ]";5

The acting is good, especially from all of the child actors, Robert De Niro, and Jason Patric, the story is interesting, and the disturbing moments really strike a chord with the audience to the degree that they want it to. Overall, the film is a solid watch and while it winds up devolving into your run-of-the-mill courtroom drama, the intrigue is still there throughout."", """", ""However, the film just never is great. It's good at most moments, but never really takes that extra step and is really missing the \""it\"" factor that makes a great film great. As of now, it is quite watchable and is still a fine film, but it had just never reached for the mountains, which is a shame. Regardless, the film was a fine watch and I cannot complain too much."" ]";5

This is no surprise, considering Pakula knows his way around conspiracy and investigative thrills, with this on full display in the film. Unfortunately, the problems with The Pelican Brief are ones found more in the script and the editing. Overly complicated, contrived, cliche, predictable, and bloated, The Pelican Brief is a film that thrills, compels, and keeps the audience hooked in from beginning to end, but is certainly prone to dragging out the inevitable. We know what will happen in the end, yet the film continues to try to distract from this with additional layers, characters, and encounters, that just seem so forced. If the film could just hone in on and become a trimmed down version of itself, it could have been a great film. Unfortunately, this one was just one editing session away from being excellent."", ""At the heart of this film is a conspiracy theory. After the assassination of two Supreme Court justices, young law student Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts) is intrigued by the murders and tries to assess who could have been involved by looking at similar opinions between the two justices. Showing her results to her lover and Professor Thomas Callahan (Sam Shepard), Shaw's theory - later dubbed the \""Pelican brief\"" - is passed onto the FBI and, from there, Shaw's life collapses all around her. As those implicated close down on her and try to suppress the investigation underway by the FBI, Shaw teams up with reporter Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington) to further investigate her brief and bring the allegations to light in an article. A spell-binding thriller, it may be rather cliche but the twists, turns, and general conspiracy element (with a post-Nixon kick to it all) really intrigue rather nicely. It is a film that may be flawed, but one cannot accuse of it not being entertaining or gripping, as the exploits of Darby and Gray as the investigate these deeply influential suspects and run for their lives from the men sent to the kill them tell a believable tale that will you keep you engaged, even when it slips into predictability."", ""Unfortunately, it is this predictability that does harm the film, especially when the plot instances can feel so contrived. As a film that 140 minutes long, The Pelican Brief is obviously far too long for what it is and much of that length is due to constant plot contrivances. Bumping into undercover hitmen or the wrong men at the wrong time, the two constantly are sent running or into hiding as a means of cheaply providing thrills and delaying the inevitable reveal of what is covered in the brief and its fallout. Further elements of the plot - the aforementioned contrivances - seems to occur just because the film needs it to move the plot ahead and provide tension. Constantly bumping into the same hitmen, killing the hitmen, or possible taking Gray off the story, the plot just runs through cliches, contrivances, and convenient plot elements to try drum up tension and anticipation when its central story is good enough to provide both if it just let it breathe."", ""That said, one of the best elements of the film is a bit cheesy, but it works so well. After having experienced a car bomb first-hand earlier in the film, Darby is on red alert after getting into a car with Gray. The audience knows there is a bomb in the car, but neither know. Reading off information they just discovered, Darby casually pulls Gray's hand away from starting the car twice, in order for him to be able to pay attention to what she is saying. Tense and slowly building anticipation for whether or not they will figure it out, the final outcome of the scene may be obvious, but Pakula's tricks in eliciting this tension work phenomenally well and create a scene that really stands out as a highlight. A scene in which hitman Khamel (Stanley Tucci) hides in an FBI agent's hotel room closet and slowly opens the door to kill him is similarly tense, demonstrating Pakula's knack for suspense and thrills, utilizing these slowly drawn out moments of tension that allow the scene's suspense to slowly build before the big pay-off."", ""While the film's predictability is certainly an issue, one element that really holds the film back is certainly how many characters are involved. With a seemingly endless number of indistinguishable slightly balding middle-aged white men in this cast, everybody blends in with one another, as none of the cast are able to really differentiate themselves enough to stand out or become a memorable supporting character. Some folks - the President or editor - are distinguishable to be clear, but far too many of the men tasked with stopping Darby and Gray or handling the investigation for the FBI just seem to blend in with one another."" ]";5

Great direction and acting bolster this one greatly, but really, it is the fantastic writing that wraps it all up with a bow, as this one is the complete package. I find Hollywood and the behind the scenes stuff endlessly interesting, so this one is of course going to be in the wheelhouse, but I enjoyed the satirical tone of the film and how it blended with the serious elements of murder. The imagery and symbolism is also very cool here and worthy of mention, as it is those small elements that really make this one a cool watch.

The ending picks up and is decidedly the best part of the film. The beginning is also strong, whereas the middle falls apart and is loosely connected to the beginning and end at best. The biggest problem, however, is the plot. In the middle, as mentioned, things fall apart and this is certainly evident in the plot. Overly convoluted and hard to follow, RockNRolla may be wildly entertaining, funny, and British, but its plot needed somebody far smarter than I to fully comprehend all the moving parts, especially since the film itself seems uninterested in telling its story.

Senator Kevin Keeley (Gene Hackman) has his own scandal brewing, however, with his co-founder of the coalition being found dead in a bed with an underage black prostitute who he derogatorily referred to as \""chocolate\"". Bad news for a guy who spent his life ensuring the \""natural\"" family stayed strong. Trying to escape the media frenzy by going with his daughter Barbara (Calista Flockhart) to meet her fiance Val (Dan Futterman) and his parents in South Beach, little does he know that the press coverage is just starting."", ""Riding high on the comic energy of Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, The Birdcage serves as the perfect vehicle for the duo's physical comedy, especially Lane. Though Williams is a comic legend who nails his role as drag club owner Armond, a far more masculine man, the flamboyantly gay drag queen headliner for the club played by Lane is hysterical. In particular, the film is quite funny when Armond plans to let Albert stay for dinner, but as gay uncle Al who walks and talks like John Wayne. Unfortunately, Albert has his own plan and shows up as Val's mother, even with Val's  female mother on her way to the dinner. While The Birdcage is undeniably cliche, the absurdity of it all and the comedic tour de force of both simply funny lines and physical comedy put on by Williams and Lane is more than enough to lift the film over the hurdles placed in front of it by those cliches."", ""That said, The Birdcage is not all comedy. Instead, underneath its surface, is a message of tolerance and acceptance. In a poignant speech to his son Val, who is hardly an **** himself and just trying to make an ill-fated attempt at a good impression, Armond says that yes he is gay. But, it has taken him a lot of time to get where is and he does not care who sees or whether they accept him or not. Albert, similarly, just wants to be himself. He is the \""mother\"" to Val and incredibly flamboyant, but Lane does a great job showing how awkward acting \""masculine\"" is to him. It is not who he is, nor is it what he wants to be. Even their house maid Agador  Spartacus (Hank Azaria) is who he wants to be and that is a man who speaks with the stereotypical \""gay accent\"" (for lack of a better term) blended with a Guatemalan accent. It is for these portrayals that the film has been called offensive as they come at a time when the world had still not fully accepted homosexuals as equals and, here, it turned them into jokes. But, crucial to understand is that the film preaches a message of choosing one's own path. All of the characters may be various stereotypes, but they own it. Agador even says he talks exactly how he wants to talk. Lane is not mocked for acting feminine, but rather his comedic height in this film is when he tries to act masculine. It is not even just funny because of him acting masculine, but rather because he is not being himself. The film's message of accepting who you are without care for how others perceive you is what saves it from being offensive. The men on display know they are being stereotypical, but it is who they want to be and who they are. Ultimately, who they are does manage to save Kevin Keeley from scandal, which certainly must also count for something."", ""Funny, sweet, and charming, The Birdcage is a film about accepting yourself above all else. It is only when they realize this that things begin to go better and the marriage can go ahead without a hitch. The more they pretended to be somebody else, the more troubles they encountered on the dinner. At the end of the day, everybody seems to realize this and it is what allows everything to go on without a hitch at that point on. That said, the film's portrayal of gay characters and some of the dialogue can certainly be offensive to some, but the film does enough to try and normalize homosexuality and show the benefits of being yourself (especially for 1996) to mostly overcome its own stereotypes. While cliche and a remake, The Birdcage is a comedy film that benefits tremendously from excellently funny turns from Robin Williams and Nathan Lane."" ]";5
1733;stargate;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Director Roland Emmerich may not be a great filmmaker in the classical sense, but he no doubt understands how to make an entertaining blockbuster. In this Egyptian mythology science fiction action adventure film, Emmerich displays this in spades with a thoroughly entertaining film that may be infectiously silly, but also knows how to satisfy the audience's craving for easy breezy entertainment. This is a classically Emmerich film with rousing speeches, a macho army man lead, and heavy reliance upon scientists for exposition about what is going on. Together alongside Emmerich's Independence Day, Stargate certainly touches on many of the same themes in regards to extraterrestrials and how it is best to probably stay away from them, for fear of them opting to destroy our world. Here, a group of soldiers and scientists unlock a portal to a far away star where the Egyptian inhabitants slave and worship the sun god Ra."", ""As with any huge dumb spectacle, Stargate is incredibly light on character development. A tough macho guy, Emmerich tries to soften Kurt Russell's rough exterior by having his son be dead from an accidental gunshot or something. Regardless, he plays a Kurt Russell type of character who literally kills an Egyptian guy and says, \""Say hi to King Tut for me, **** Taking on Ra all by himself and charging into the pyramid well ahead of the rest of his men, Kurt Russell is set to save Earth even though he does not wish to return and face the fact that his son is dead again. Instead, he would rather die on this star or planet or desert thing. Alongside him is Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader), a nerdy and brilliant expert on Ancient Egypt whose controversial and different beliefs regarding Egypt get him ostracized by his fellow scholars. Now presented with an opportunity to explore this old discovery from 1928 that contains mysterious hieroglyphics or some other design, he is able to prove his previously insane theories to be true."", ""What ensues is the men pissing off Ra, Daniel having sex with an Egyptian slave babe, and the men starting an uprising with the youth to overthrow Ra's tyrannical leadership. With glowing eyes, girlish clothes and features, and an ability to suck a person's brain from their head via his fingers and some glowing waves, the apparently male Ra is a terrifying villain. For all of the film's sheer insanity in regards to developing Ra and his limited backstory, Emmerich's direction of him never ceases to create intensity. With every step he takes, there is considerable power and it is readily apparent that he is not a being to be trifled with to any degree. Rather, he is a powerful being that is willing to kill his own people in order to maintain power. In the film's plotting as a whole, Emmerich manages to create a variety of feelings. From a sense of wonder and awe when the world is first explored and reached to great tension as the men traverse the land and encounter Ra, Stargate manages to be a blockbuster with tremendous scope and gravitas that really elevates it into being phenomenal entertainment. In playing its absurdities quite straight, the film makes them oddly believable and not cheesy. Rather, this science fiction world of Ancient Egypt blending with our own is an incredibly believable one with excellently presented mythology and satisfying feelings of wonder, adventure, and thrills."", ""Thematically, as with many films about alien encounters, Stargate shows the dangers inherent in involving the military. Escalating the situation through following orders, Kurt Russell puts Earth at risk by angering Ra. Focused on executing their missions and not in exploring the land, the soldiers are often saved by Daniel and his willingness to explore and to learn. However, on the other hand, Daniel learns to take risks and to fight from the soldiers, highlighting the symbiotic relationship that forms between the two entities. By the end of the film, both Kurt and Daniel take paths neither of them had previously anticipated and are willing to embark on their greatest personal journeys of discovery and perseverance. Yet, it is in that thematic discussion of a tough man being forced to embrace life once again and a nerdy guy learning to toughen up sometimes that the film really begins to hint at its cliches. This is what really drags the film down as it is far too like every other summer action blockbuster. With numbing action that lacks any sense of staging and disorients more than it thrills along with a shoe-horned in romantic angle, Stargate winds up being far too run-of-the-mill and overdone. The climax further demonstrates the way in which the film is just stretched too thin with  Kurt Russell fighting the same nameless guy for nearly five minutes. The scene goes on for far too long, as do scenes of them meeting with the villagers. However, in contrast, scenes of the men learning about the stargate and entering it seem incredibly rushed."" ]";5

The Master of Horror knows the genre better than anyone, thus he knows the rules and knows how to poke fun at them, while using them at their most effective. In all honesty, Scream's greatest accomplishment is justifying the cliches.

The least satirical scene, it shows off Craven's ability as a horror master. He creates tension, atmosphere, and fear with relative ease, which sets the tone for the rest of the film. The opening is so horrifying, it really makes the rest of the film seem that much scarier. Even better, the mystery surrounding this scene lasts until the end of the film as you are left to constantly wonder who the killer is, with conflicting clues and knowledge of cliches playing through your mind."", """", ""The story of Scream is a simple one and one that would be suitable in a typical horror film, but is incredibly effective. As is always the case, suburban horror movies are classic, due to their relatability and the way in which suburban life can be a horror for many (even if it is devoid of monsters). The story is bolstered by the constant references to other horror films that point out the cliches at every turn  and almost prep you for them to come up. In many regards, Scream tips its hand so many times, yet you ignore it because you imagine it is simply mocking cliches. Instead, Scream is practically screaming at you to realize that this is a cliche horror film, just a self-aware one. Thus, the films sense of irony is incredibly rich and used very effectively."", """", ""That strength does become the main weakness at times, however. The way in which Scream pulls its punches by pointing out scary cliches just before they happen kind of ruins the atmosphere, especially towards the end. Constantly, the film points out scary moments before they happen, which lessens their impact and leaves you laughing more than anything. Given that the film sets out to be both scary and funny, this pulling of punches towards the end leaves you anything but scared. Entertained, sure, but it is clear that Craven lost sense of the balance beam he expertly toed between the two genres in the first and second acts.

1735;twister;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""In 2017, a film such as Twister being made would be pretty inconceivable. It is a big-budget film that basically feels as though it was a film made to just build up anticipation for a future ride at Universal Studios. Yes, it did become a ride at Universal Studios, but it feels more akin to the movie being mere marketing for the ride, rather than the ride coming as a result of the movie. A special effects bonanza, Twister is hardly a good film in the typical sense, but it is a good film in its own way. What saves the film is its sense of purpose and scope. It feels like a blockbuster and one that is unafraid to delve into serious topics in honoring the storm chaser profession with costly special effects. While cliche and derivative, the film powers through them and delivers terrific entertainment that is hardly a mindless blockbuster."", ""Often times, on sites other than Letterboxd, I am accused of hating fun. Big blockbusters are not my thing. Marvel films are hollow parades of predictability and action scenes that exist merely to look cool and show off technology than to actually do anything plot-wise. They are devoid of thrills or entertainment value. The films have just become more like the X Games with guys doing tricks on bikes or the World's Strongest Man re-runs on ESPN with men flexing as they reign in a plane. For those into that, the films are appealing, but it is not my style. Films such as Twister, however, are my style. It special effects, which are tremendous even today, feel built to be experienced first hand. They are a throwback to old school disaster movies with objects flying from every which direction and the characters forced to run to the right and left on a set with real objects, rather than just a green screen. These more stripped down special effects are fun and far more engaging, but also serve a purpose plot-wise. There are no moments where something is thrown in because it looks cool. The twisters are needed. The carnage is needed. Every piece is there because it communicates the scope of these tornadoes and the danger storm chasers find themselves in during the course of their scientific duty. The special effects, therefore, are quite tight and well deployed. This is a film built to impress with great effects, but its effects create well earned tension and thrills that deliver splendid entertainment."", ""The tornadoes, however, are only part of Twister's appeal. It is a blockbuster unafraid to become real. Depicting the real damage of tornadoes, the film develops tremendous stakes. Watching the storm chasers trying to play these sensors into the tornado is given incredible purpose as it would allow them to create a new warning system to give people more time to get to safety. It would be a life saving discovery and, therefore, essential. This is not some \""save the world from whatever\"" mission, this is a small increase in warning time, but an essential step for the citizens of the area nonetheless. Thus, while the special effects and tornadoes do look quite \""cool\"", they are also weirdly haunting. As they tear across the country side, you can feel the fear and anticipation of the citizens and the storm chasers as it bears down on populated areas throughout Oklahoma. While the film does not develop these random citizens at all (nor should it), the film is blessed with the fact that it is real because it immediately makes the destruction and human suffering feel real. It gives the film great stakes, but also great scope and purpose with the mission these people are on carrying great importance and weight."", ""That said, the film does suffer from its stock characters. From the married couple who used to be partners at work, but are now separated and one having a new spouse who simply does not \""get\"" their passion, the film's romantic center is doomed to be cliche. A loud and obnoxious comic relief stock character, a stock supporting character that will clearly wind up in danger, a bad backstory and family tragedy, a useless \""villain\"", and a typical cast of unrecognizable character actors in small roles that help to chase storms, accompany the film's poor romantic set-up. In focusing on its special effects, Twister did forget to build worthwhile characters, but fortunately, this problem is helped and not by the special effects. Rather, the stakes. We do not need much to root for them. We root against the villain because he is a bad storm chaser who does not listen to advice or words of wisdom. His device will fail to help the people in tornado alley. If Bill (Bill Paxton) and Jo (Helen Hunt) get in the right position, however, they can help because they know what they are doing. Regardless of how one-dimensional they are, director Jan De Bont's aforementioned inclusion of the damage caused by a tornado helps to alleviate issues with the characterization as it gives the audience a cause and group of people to easily root for."" ]";5

In addition, the writing is great and the characters are all really well crafted and fleshed out. For as many characters as there were, it was never hard to identify what made them tick.

Though it is possible that Eastwood did not take inspiration from Lean's film, the two are incredibly similar thematically and plot-wise. Portraying two people meeting for a fleeting few days in 1965, this film is a transcendent look at love and denial that is positively heart wrenching. Set in both 1965 and the present day, the film looks at the affair between Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) and Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) as it occurs and as it is viewed by Francesca's two children as they learn about it after their mother's death. Both a passionate and mournful look at love, the film is a brilliantly constructed look at relationships."", ""In 1965, Francesca is an unhappy housewife. With her husband and children out of town for a few days, she plans on just getting some time away from them and breathing. However, photographer Robert Kincaid comes to town to take pictures of the bridges of her Iowa hometown for a National Geographic spread. Quickly falling for him, their relationship is brief, just four days, but very much akin to the one in Brief Encounter. Robert is not married to a woman, but is married to his work. Taking him all over the world, he is devoted to the world to the detriment of his relationships with women. Francesca, meanwhile, ditched her dreams long ago to have children. The part of her that would jump and leave at the drop of a hat is long gone, for fear of instilling a bad message to her children. Thus, both know their relationship is doomed. It will end because there are forces beyond their control that pull them away from one another. Yet, as much as it hurts them both, neither wish to forget what they felt over the course of those four days as they, by their own admission, cram a lifetime of passion into just four days."", ""With the relationship defined in small moments - Robert picking her flowers, dancing in the kitchen, taking photos at the bridge, laying in the bathtub, and simply talking at the table - the romance is incredibly authentic. Yet, no moment really rips your heart out akin to the last chance they have to be together in spirit. With her husband Richard (Jim Haynie) home now, Francesca goes into town with him where she sees Robert. Staring at one another in the rain, the film refuses to go for the overly dramatic and unrealistic conclusion. They look at one another, Francesca leans over in the front seat to get a better look at him in the pouring rain, but they go their separate ways. Leaving town, Richard winds up behind Robert. In his truck, Robert can be seen hanging the crucifix Francesca gave him on his rearview mirror and waiting at a green light. He gives her one last chance to come with him. She clutches the door handle and waits. Her worries about Robert no longer wanting her are long gone. The connection is mutual. The experience unique. They are brief soulmates, but Francesca must choose: her family or Robert. In this tense and dramatic scene, the drama feels real. It is not manufactured and you can feel her dilemma. Regardless of what she chooses, she will never feel complete as her heart is guaranteed to be pulled in two separate directions. As is the case throughout, Streep beautifully portrays this complex character and the dilemmas before her. She acts out at Robert for making her feel this way, is set to leave, and is set to stay. She cannot make up her mind, but settles on hurting the least amount of people. Were it not for Streep's powerful performance, the film would still be good but not great. This is the perfect marriage between actor and material as she brings power and grace to the picture, as well as the dilemmas put before her character."", ""One of the film's greatest assets, however, is the portrayal of Francesca's husband. Often times in these films about affairs, the spouse is shown to be boring or abusive or any number of things. Robert, however, is not treated in such a way. He is a great husband and father. On his death bed, he expresses his regret that he never gave Francesca her dreams. His role in the film is moving and powerfully written. A large part of why Francesca stays is to not hurt Richard and it is easy to see why. He is a beautiful soul who never hurt anybody. Why would he deserve to be hurt in such a way by his wife, who he never wronged. Thus, by not portraying him negatively, The Bridges of Madison County brilliantly shows the pull her marriage has on her heart. Had he been portrayed negatively, it would be a mystery as to why she would stay when she was so unhappy. But, due to his characterization, it becomes clear that she stayed because she loved him. She could not hurt somebody she loved for the simple reason that he was not her soulmate. It is a truly selfless act and yet another example of her giving up her dreams for her family."" ]";5

John Travolta turns in a truly cool and calculated performance as this loan shark turned wannabe Hollywood producer. He really makes this role his own. Additionally, it is well-written and the plot is compelling. I never found it overly funny, but this was not a major problem in and of itself. The main detraction here has to be how truly generic the film is. From beginning to end, it is completely derivative of every film about Hollywood and/or crime that came before. This is obviously not ideal and it leaves you feeling as if you had seen this movie dozens of times before. That said, it is a fun film with very well developed characters, good pacing, and strong writing. Overall, Get Shorty works as both a satire of the crime genre and on its own as a crime film."" ]";5
1739;jfk;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Spinning an impeccable yarn about the conspiracy theories revolving the assassination of John F. Kennedy, JFK is a captivating, riveting, and truly compelling film. Structured as a bit of a courtroom drama with New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) investigating the case, interviewing people with knowledge of the situation, and presenting his case to the jury. While compelling, the film is definitely very long, especially the director's cut. The film does a good job weaving everybody into the final case, while also showing just how hard it was to prove his conspiracy case against businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) being involved in the assassination of JFK. What Garrison does do, however, is convince the audience of every conspiracy theory possible. Laying out the evidence and painstakingly going though the minutia of details, everything sounds plausible and backed up with incredible evidence. What definitely becomes clear is the fact that there were multiple shooters. While Stone no doubt framed it in that fashion with the details he had, it should just be obvious to anybody knowing about the law of physics in relation to the magical bullet."", ""Powerfully told, smartly written, and excellently acted, the film is anchored by a terrific lead performance by Kevin Costner. The embattled New Orleans DA with a tough home life as a result of his obsession, his home life may be a bit cliched. But while he is interviewing people and pitching his case, Costner is fantastic. The closing monologue as Garrison makes his case to the people is impeccably acted and written with Costner nailing every line, every question, and every moment of that sequence. Stone's direction turns the sequence into the equivalent of a hypnotic episode and Costner slinks right down into it perfectly. He is a terrific lawyer and detective in this film and matches the film's epic quality."", ""However, what truly adds to the film's epic feeling is the supporting cast. Littered in this film are various tremendous actors giving terrific supporting performances. These include, but are not limited to, Jack Lemmon, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Edward Asner, Gary Oldman, Laurie Metcalf, and Michael Rooker. The whole cast, from beginning to end, truly nail their roles and add brilliantly to the odd cast of characters linked to the assassination of Kennedy. With each interview sequence being incredibly tense, riveting, and well told, the film finds power in its dialogue that more than entertains. With each interview, it becomes tough to balance everything we have heard in our minds, but Stone is smart to include wrap-up scenes in the DA's office every once in a while where the group find out exactly where they are and what they have that they can use in a courtroom."", ""That said, it becomes clear during the film that people are just not ready. Garrison spins this incredible case that very clearly points to the conspiracy, but he is brick walled throughout by the media. Even though the jury agrees there was a conspiracy behind the murder, the connection to Clay Shaw is tenuous at best relying on sketchy witnesses. But, to uncover the conspiracy behind anything, weeding through what the witnesses say is a must, no matter who they are. People too willingly write off conspiracy nuts as crazy loons, even if some of what they say may be based in fact or covered up fact. Not every inch of conspiracy theories are true, but more than people are willing to admit. JFK shows this incredibly well with even employees in the DA's office expressing doubt about what they have and the horrible witnesses they talked to. That said, the key to understanding the assassination is given X (Donald Sutherland). In a terrific supporting role, Sutherland's mysterious military colonel tells Garrison that the who is just scenery to distract people from the why. Incredibly true, every conspiracy theory falls down when people get down into the who. Often times, there is very little evidence supporting the who or loose connections at best. If people focused on the why and worried about the who later, then maybe something would actually come out of most conspiracy theories."", ""Long, maybe too long, but compelling and a truly unique conspiracy thriller mixed with courtroom drama, JFK is one of director Oliver Stone's best work with an excellent performance from Costner and the whole cast. Easily convincing the audience that there was a conspiracy, it does not pretend to show us the who because it hardly matters who kills Kennedy. Rather, Stone's film painstakingly sets the scene for why and makes a compelling case on that front. Now, it is up to the jury of the audience to figure out whether they believe it or not."" ]";5
1740;risky-business;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A classic 1980s teen coming of age comedy, Risky Business is certainly a unique film. The story of a young man, Joel (Tom Cruise), whose parents leave town and give him the house for the weekend, the film certainly goes in a direction that it is unexpected. This is all kicked off when one of his friends jokingly calls a prostitute and, after a black transvestite shows up and recommends somebody more Joel's speed, he is introduced to young prostitute Lana (Rebecca De Mornay). What ensues is a week of debauchery, chaos, college interviews, and studying. A neo-noir esque coming of age tale of materialism and capitalism, Risky Business earns its classic status with solid performances from its cast and an infectious feeling of fun and audacity that permeates the whole film."", ""As may be clear, one of the biggest issues for Risky Business is its plot. While it works as a comment on the state of society for high schoolers and the trepidation one feels when heading to college, its plot is a bit far fetched. A high school guy strikes up a constant companionship with a prostitute over the course of a week and opens a brothel? That is a little too crazy and can somewhat hurt the film as a relatable story of teen angst. While Tom Cruise finds his spots to bring it back to its roots as a coming of age story, the story often brings the film into a completely new genre with a variety of different thematic explorations that feel out of place in a coming of age film. Fortunately, this is not your run-of-the-mill coming of age film and, while the plot is a bit much, it does help set up the greatest strength of the film."", ""That strength is its visual style. Films such as Michael Mann's Collateral or Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive feel like later successors to the way in which director Paul Brickman catches suburban Chicago at night time. With neon covered landscapes and Joel even having a neon sign in his room, Risky Business is one of the first films of the neon revolution and feels oddly digitalized for a film that obviously was not. Adding to the equation is a neo-noir take on the coming of age film with Rebecca De Mornay portraying the seductive and sensual femme fatale, Lana. Always convincing Joel to make bad decisions, she is the very definition of a dangerous woman and is one who lets the plot unfold through this guidance. Constantly finding himself between a rock and a hard place because he cannot escape the clutches of her beauty, Joel succumbs to her every whim. Adding this to the aesthetic of the film, it feels like Risky Business is often a unique take on adding neo-noir style and some of its story conventions to the coming of age story, which honestly, works because of capable direction and lustfully great turn from Rebecca De Mornay who defines sex in the film. At one point, she wears a fedora-esque hat with a jacket and skirt and somehow even that looks brilliant on her, so it is not hard to see Joel following her around like a puppy dog."", ""Akin to Drive again, Risky Business also features a vintage 1980s synth score courtesy of Tangerine Dream that certainly adds to that neo-noir feeling of the film for me. That said, the score pales in comparison to the scene in which Joel has sex with Lana on a train as we hear \""In the Air Tonight\"" by Phil Collins. It is impossible to deny that the song itself is a masterpiece, so adding it to a sex scene on a train only serves to make that one of the most iconic sex scenes off all-time. Of course, where the film finds success is also in its destruction of innocence. This scene goes a long way to doing that as Joel is a charming, smart, and thoroughly innocent young man who has only dreamed of doing something with a woman. Thus, the situation he finds himself in with Lana is beyond foreign and almost surreal. Cruise pulls this off with an always charming and charismatic turn that may not always stick the landing, but it does hint at his potential to become a top-notch actor."", ""Yet, the film finds some great success in its exploration of themes such as materialism. Constantly trying to replace stolen and valuable possessions of his parents, Joel still draws ire from his parents when a glass egg has a miniscule crack inside of it. This really drives home just how important these material goods are to his parents and also all of Joel's friends who come from a similar silver spoon lifestyle and are the very definition of preppy. All of them really define materialism and the final results of the American dream for kids whose parents have made it big, as they are all entitled, spoiled, and convinced the world owes them something for just being themselves. With capable performances, Risky Business highlights yet another good 1980s teen comedy actress whose filmography unfortunately turned into a who's who of movies nobody has seen in 20 years. That said, De Mornay makes the most of her premier role, as does the future superstar Tom Cruise. Together, they turn a crazy crime"" ]";5
1741;a-little-princess;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Will I ever enjoy an Alfonso Cuaron film? Gravity is probably my favorite by him, though it is complete garbage in hindsight. Had I not seen it in cinemas, its paper thin story and horribly annoying performance from Sandra Bullock would bother me more, but those visuals are first rate. Children of Men is probably a film deserving of a rewatch though, as of now, I really did not care for it. However, I did see it a few years ago. One without an excuse is Y Tu Mama Tambien which I absolutely abhorred. One of my least favorite films I had ever seen. Drove me up the wall and made me run for the showers. Perhaps not my type of film, but regardless, the mere thought of that film sends me running to go turn on the shower head. It is instinct at this point. A Little Princess, an update on a classic fairy tale, joins the pantheon of beloved Cuaron films to completely pass me by and wonder how this man has become so popular. Am I alone in not liking him at all? Visually stunning films sure, but let us not pretend that he has not entirely benefited from a working relationship with Emmanuel Lubezki. Remove Lubezki from the equation and I am running for the hills from his work without any hesitation."", ""As for this film alone, the film suffers in its characters and in its emotional manipulation. Yes, it is a fairy tale, but the character of Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron) hardly works. Abusing children and having the entire police force sent to arrest a small girl by accusing her of theft she clearly did not commit seems highly illogical and either the creation of the imaginative mind of a little girl or purely nonsensical writing. Personally, I lean towards the latter. Furthermore, once Sara (Liesel Matthews) is freed from her dungeon - in which she and friend Becky (Vanessa Lee Chester) are forced to work without pay to earn their keep in the home and also starved as punishment - we see Miss Minchin in the streets as a woman who is practically homeless as a result. She has been punished for her cruel nature, which is only fair. Yet, while she is comically cruel to the point that it lacks any basis in common sense and smacks of the writers trying to find a shorthand way to turn her into the antagonist, her fall is turned into comedic fodder. She, who looked down upon those with nothing, is then looked down upon the audience and the film itself for working for a living after losing her job as the headmaster of the school. Yes, she is a cruel wench, but is it not then equally wrong for us to mock her and laugh at her predicament? She may have reaped what she sows, but deserves a helping hand nonetheless and should learn from her errors. Being mocked sends the wrong message to the children audience of the film who will see her punished, laugh, and write her off as an irredeemable person incapable of change. Had she been reformed, shown the light, and taught to act like a reasonable human being, it would show that people can change for the better and those who are at the bottom should be helped, not mocked."", ""The character of Ram Dass (Errol Sitahal) also appears to be a \""magical negro\"" stock character. The man responsible for keeping Sara going during her days at rock bottom, he exists to merely provide happiness to Sara and to benefit her by nursing her father back to health after his time served in World War I. He appears to have no life other than serving Sara and other whites, while being capable of performing magical acts such as transforming her room (even her bed sheets, which she was laying on) in her sleep to save her from being starved by Miss Minchin. Presently, this character is not seen as a magical negro by film critics, most likely because he is not black and instead an Indian man. Yet, though he does not meet the race requirement of the term, his characterization and role in the film is solely to serve our white protagonist and perform magical acts to keep her happy and motivated. If he is not a \""magical negro\"", then I have no idea what this character could be classified as."", ""All of that said, however, I am not entirely a curmudgeon. A tale about a girl being reunited with her father after spending time at the bottom and learning to look past her rich upbringing and spread joy to all, A Little Princess is an uplifting and thoroughly magical tale. As a fairy tale, we see this one act as a revisionist fairy tale of sorts. Instead of showing one prince and princess, the film argues that every girl is a princess. They have the right to love who they want and to behave how they want. There are no restrictions on a princess and every girl deserves to experience this freedom and break free of the bonds put on them by society. For this message, the film is quite powerful, even if its ending is entirely emotionally manipulative and predictable. It is so heart warming and moving, however, it practically works."" ]";5

My first - The Umbrellas of Cherbourg - certainly matched and exceeded my expectations. A musical about life, love, and loss, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a beautifully written film that is imperfect, but gorgeously crafted. Operatic in style, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg features no grand set pieces nor any single song. Rather, it is written as a typical film would be, except it is sung. The end result is a beautifully written film that may lack true character development, but its music is so brilliantly put together, it is easy to turn a blind eye to its flaws."", """", ""Telling the story of Genevieve (Catherine Deneuve) and her relationship with Guy (Nino Castelnuevo), a man who is set to leave for war in Algeria, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg shows both the dark and light side of love and marriage. Demy's film does not shy away from showing the pain it can cause and the torment it leaves Genevieve with when Guy leaves for war, but the film equally shows the ecstasy and joy. The end result is a sweet film that feels endlessly watchable and thoroughly enjoyable. Though not truly dreamlike - like La La Land has been described - The Umbrellas of Cherbourg does have a certain airy and light feeling to it. This is matched by the largely bright color scheme of the film, which has the impact of making the film feel truly vibrant. This vibrancy is matched the sung dialogue. Had this been a spoken film, it would have lost much of its impact. As it stands, the singing bolsters the beauty of the rest of the film and breathes life into it as a whole."", """", ""However, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is far from perfect. Though beautifully sung and brilliantly acted - especially by Deneuve - the film's characters leave much to be desired. By the end, it feels as though things speed along too quickly in the story and things just happen. This leaves many dramatic sequences feeling quite hollow and emotionless for the audience, as they are far too sudden to have a true impact. Yet, individually, its characters are terrific. Well-written and able to communicate often without speaking, the film's characters seem incredibly real and authentic both in 1960s France and the modern world."", """", ""Musically, the film is great. All of the actors complete their singing lines terrifically and the score - which is a constant in the background - is fantastic. The music certainly, as mentioned before, contributes to this light, airy, and warm feeling the film radiates. Though the plot can often depict somewhat traumatic experiences for the characters, the film never ceases to be a pleasing and comfortable experience. This is, in large part, thanks to the music that provides a degree of pleasure that escapes explanation."", """", ""As a whole, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg - the first film I have seen by Demy - is a tremendous experience. A romantic musical, the film depicts both the good and the bad side of love with equal passion. The music and the signing are tremendous and wind up covering up the main negative of the film, which is the far-too-quick pacing of the story towards the end of the film that removes much of the emotional impact it could have."" ]";5

Gloriously 1980s in its approach to action and fight sequences, the film's special effects and choreography may be a bit stilted and unseemly by today's standards, but were more than good for the time. Plus, they feel very in line with the comic books. From the set pieces to the costumes to the dialogue, Tim Burton's Batman feels like a comic book and this is why the film is ultimately so fun. It knows none of it is too serious, so it has fun with an outrageous premise, plot, and scenarios, as it knows what it is: a summer blockbuster adapted from a comic book that is made to please. This, of course, is not to imply it is not dark. It is far darker than, say, Marvel movies nowadays. However, it stops well short of the grim nature of the new DC adaptations."", """", ""Michael Keaton does a very good job in the lead role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, but the real star is Jack Nicholson.

From hardcore gangster to gleeful murderer, Nicholson does a killer job capturing the Joker and bringing him to life. He has been upstaged in more recent times by Heath Ledger, but this does nothing to diminish Nicholson's turn as the famed comic book villain. The costume design of the Joker is also stellar. The same goes for Batman with both of their \""outfits\"" being well crafted and, honestly, how I often view the characters. Along a similar line, the production design is also killer. The scene in which the Batplane rains hellfire on the Joker and the scene on the cathedral both highlight this look.

This is a scene that gives Tarantino to spin this crime yarn into something of higher literary significance and he does it, with a gorgeously penned scene. Walken and Hopper do the writing justice, plus some."", ""In a typically chameleon-like performance, Gary Oldman also steals the show as pimp Drexl Spivey. Confronted by Clarence to free Alabama (Patricia Arquette) from his grasp and also the man with the coke from Blue Lou Boyle, Oldman's Drexl is a black man wannabe with a scarred face, one eye, and long brown dreadlocks. This man really is a chameleon. Psychotic, unhinged, and an undeniably wild pimp, Oldman's character may be my favorite from the film, even though Walken's terrific Sicilian gangster gets the best scene in the entire film."", ""Naturally, James Gandolfini is also tremendous in this film as Don Vincenzo's trigger man Virgil. Roughing up Alabama to find out where the coke is, Virgil takes a liking to her and let's her take one shot before he finishes her off. Menacing, tough, and yet warm and oddly approachable like only an oddly good guy Gandolfini can be, the film finds yet another great scene with Galdolfini's moment in the spotlight."", ""The film also finds a great source of energy from Brad Pitt's Floyd. He never really gets a scene to himself, rather he is always a supporting character. That said, he is hysterical as a druggy who is always high. Letting the gangsters know Clarence's every move while offering them drugs the whole time, Floyd is a real gem of a character. No surprise he inspired Pineapple Express given how well he would fit in that film. The best moment with Floyd comes as a gangster pulls a gun causing a delayed, high reaction from Pitt as he mutters, \""Woah.\"""", ""Yet, the stars here are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. Less compelling than the rest of the supporting cast, their twisted love story is one only Tarantino could concoct. In essence, it is a dry run for Natural Born Killers without the constantly bloodshed and via the direction of Tony Scott. Thus, it is less coked up and more restrained than Oliver Stone's film. Though less interesting than the other characters, their Bonnie & Clyde-esque matchup of a hooker with a heart of gold and a lonely man with limited romantic experience is somehow charming and sweat. True Romance is a film that violently argues that, to love somebody, you must kill for them. Clarence and Alabama pull the trigger for one another, in the most romantic acts ever and in an attempt to be Elvis (Val Kilmer) cool."", ""Kinetic, insane, and thoroughly Tarantino, the film is not really a Tony Scott film. Yet, his assured hand does help keep it a bit more restrained without descending into complete parody. With a tremendous cast that all nail their roles, True Romance is a very good film that is simply fun and somehow romantic."" ]";5

Jesse Eisenberg is very good in the lead role, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also both very strong, and Woody Harrelson was born for this role. Nothing like watching Woody massacre zombies with the kind of glee only he can show, while being oddly vulnerable at the same time. A funny film, the romantic elements do not feel forced, neither do the emotional moments. As gory as a zombie apocalypse needs to be, even the violence manages to be comedic here as they manage to suck every joke they can out of everything going on, which is great. I love when films do that. Overall, Zombieland may not be finding a place in the Library of Congress any time soon, but it is still a very fun and well made film."" ]";5

It is hard to pick a standout, since they all stood out. The film is very successful in large part because of those actors, but not solely because of them. The film is slow at times, but never boring, as it manages to keep you hooked all the way through as you attempt to figure out whether the allegations are true or not. One of the films major successes is how it sets up its characters. All are very well developed in a short period of time and you feel like you begin to understand what is going on, but the film manages to keep the \""Doubt\"" alive as the give little bits of information supporting both sides, allowing you to almost never truly figure out if the priest did as accused or not. Really, you find yourself picking sides at times, only to have the film throw you back into questioning once you think you figured it out. Director John Patrick Shanley certainly directed this one very well and while the performances of the three leads stand tall, the script and direction done by him were right there with the acting."" ]";5

Michael Sheen and Frank Langella are brilliant together and play off of one another perfectly. Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon, Rebecca Hall, and Sam Rockwell, add to the acting talent here with strong supporting turns. The film is very well directed by Ron Howard with the pacing and occasional docudrama style being a perfect fit for this type of film. The film really feels fresh and engaging due to this style as the film really ropes you in and brings you into the 1970s. The film is very well paced, which is easy to pick up on. As the premise could have been quite boring, the good pacing makes itself apparent when the film is never boring. Instead, it leaves you wanting more and on the edge of your seat waiting to see where the interview ends up. Overall, Frost/Nixon is exactly what a political drama should be. The film is not just very well made, but also a true actor's showcase."" ]";5

I was unfamiliar with all of the actors, but they each did a great job. The direction from Cary Fukunaga, director of the acclaimed HBO miniseries True Detective, is stupendous. This feature combined with True Detective cement Fukunaga as a young director to watch. The cinematography is great and the story is very well developed and well told. The character development here is also very interesting. The growth of many of the characters in the film is as beautiful to watch as it is depressing. Ultimately, this is a immigration tale set against the violent gangs that dominate much of Honduras and some of the other Central American nations. This contrast of hope vs despair is a riveting thing to watch. Ultimately, Sin Nombre is a great and moving film that will have you wrapped into its world from the very beginning."" ]";5

For example, the story felt a little on the short side and the character development, as seems to be the case with many films based on military actions, seems to be pretty thin as well. But, on the plus side, the acting was really good across the board. Tom Cruise caught a lot of flack here, but I enjoyed his performance here.

No matter how bleak things may be in the world, as astutely pointed out by Boris Yellikoff (David), we all might as well embrace our desires, wishes, and dreams. If it provides happiness, do it and expect nothing less. If something makes you unhappy, stop doing it immediately. Though we all may die in the end and are a doomed race, certain to lead ourselves to extinction, we all have the right to make life less unbearable by finding something or somebody we love. Even if it is wrong in your mind, nothing that makes you truly happy and fulfilled is wrong (with exceptions, e.g. murder or killing people, but that is the exception not the rule)."", ""Portraying an advanced Woody Allen character, Larry David is not just misanthropic, self-absorbed, cynical, and intensely pessimistic, he is Larry David. He may be playing a Jew named Boris, but he is Larry David or, at least, how I would imagine him to be in real life. That said, he does quite well here with incredibly smart and witty lines throughout, as well as lines so cruelly mean and open that it is impossible not to laugh. He is a brutally honest man who would be well served with a filter, but why filter your thoughts when you will die anyways? This is the line of thinking he is obsessed with it, but it is clear as to the source of his revolt and anger towards the human race: he is unhappy. He may be a perfect match for his first wife and his second wife is Evan Rachel Wood (talk about winning the lotto, eh?), but he is still unhappy. By the end, he has finally realized this and though an intensely negative person still, he has opened himself up to enjoying life and all of its futile little events."", ""This journey is one experienced by every other character.

By the time Randy (Henry Cavill) comes into her life, she is now ready for love and able to be a mature, smart adult at the same time. Her mother, Marietta (Patricia Clarkson), shows this same thing, but as an adult. Left by her husband for another woman, she quickly embraces her hidden sexual passion and love of photography. Heck, even her husband John (Ed Begley Jr.) gives himself over to happiness by pursuing a relationship with another man. Against their beliefs of how people should be and act, the entire family from the south has finally had their minds opened to happiness. It may seem that they were \""cultured\"" or \""shown the world\"", but they really just became willing to take chances and embrace who they really are. In essence, they went with \""whatever works\"", not what the beliefs instilled in them since birth had taught them to think was perfect or the right path for somebody to take."", ""Though the film is pretty typical Woody Allen fare in terms of its negativity and belief that life just happens randomly, especially when it comes to love, Whatever Works is still an incredibly fun film. Its protagonist may be a bit off-putting, but he is also oddly charming and a perfect fit for an Allen film. With the rest of the cast, the film further develops its themes of life's randomness, while also ramming home the film's militant beliefs regarding religion and life. That said, it is neither anti-religion or anti-life. It is a film about a man so wrapped up in himself and unhappy, he is unable to see beyond the wall he built around himself to protect him from the outside world. In that way, though witty and whip smart, the film is also oddly tragic in how it shows Boris continue to drive people away and burrow himself deeper into routine and anger. Once you look past the rough spots though, he is a good man who simply hates himself and once he learns to stop hating himself, things can improve. Thus, though tragic, Whatever Works is a film that ends with assured beauty and a crucial message to embrace whatever makes your life worth living."" ]";5

However, there are definitely a lot of long portions of this one that are not all that funny. This one is certainly very dark at times, but the humor of the situations lighten it up a tad. The film is also an interesting discussion of posthumous celebrity, suicide, and teenagers. However, the film itself is pretty predictable. As you watch it, you can pretty much assume how it will end, but that is not a huge deal to me, though it does hurt the overall enjoyment since I knew what was ultimately going to happen.

The cinematography is good, the costume design is very good, and the production design is very good. The script is also solid and gets the job done.

Like all Tarantino fare, we get our stylized violence, our pitch black comedy, and of course our closeup of an actress' foot (Diane Kruger here). Also, we get a great film. A close second place for me behind Pulp Fiction in terms of Tarantino, Inglourious Basterds features great cinematography and great acting, namely from Christoph Waltz, who absolutely killed it. Brad Pitt was also great and quite hilarious, to boot. From the onset of the film, Waltz' performance takes center stage as we watch him do what he does best: hunt Jews. We then see the same from his counterpart, Pitt, who is great at killing Nazis. These first two parts of the film really setup the film incredibly well for the final act, where spoilers. In addition to Waltz and Pitt, the whole cast did exceptionally well, in partucular Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger. Michael Fassbender, Daniel Bruhl, and shockingly, Mike Myers, all have good turns as well. Throughout the film, there are many different genres being used terrifically. Of note, the comedic elements were great, in particular the scene in which Pitt attempts to speak Italian. These moments of comedy help to lighten the mood against the hyper violence that takes place (though never too dusturbing, typically the stuff depicted would bother me more, but Tarantino is so stylish, he gets away with it). However, the film also includes many thrilling/suspenseful scenes where your heart is in your throat as you await what happens, while coupling that with elements of war, drama, adventure, action genres, all of which used very artfully and really help to add to the general entertainment of the film."", """", ""On the negative side, the final part is a tad over the top. It came off as extremely odd and slightly off putting. However, the impact on the viewer is certainly still great and any over the topness is not a major complaint, rather something small that bugged me a little bit.

With a great emotional center and theories on loneliness, happiness, marriage, and purpose in life, the film has a lot to say throughout. The writing is spectacular as is the direction and when the characters feel hurt, so does the audience. This is largely thanks to the great acting from George Clooney, Anna Kendrick, and Vera Farmiga. However, the true success of the film comes from how real it all feels. It never feels fake and it almost feels as though you are watching a documentary about these regular people. In addition, it was very timely with its release, as it focuses on a guy who fires people for a living and came out in 2009. On the topic of starting over, the film does a very good job and portrays these people with a lot of compassion and honesty.

The film is very artful, in particular the 17 minute shot of Bobby Sands and the priest talking, which is an absolutely brilliantly filmed, acted, and written, sequence. Throughout, the writing is stellar and the acting, especially from Michael Fassbender, is great. The only things holding me back from liking this more are the beginning, which is oddly confusing and unfocused, as we get very little explanation as to wgat is happening, as well as the pace. At times, the pace is deathly slow and it certainly took me out of the film at times and since it took me a bit to get into it anyways, that is not a great characteristic.

It may not be the most historically accurate film ever, but watching Clough's career unfold was incredibly dramatic and, as a soccer fan, informative as well as entertaining. The shots of soccer were done brilliantly as well, as were the interactions between the managers and players.

Though Blunt and the other actors are at their very best, the film feels overstuffed. As it tries to showcase many characters and multiple years of Victoria's reign, it has the problem of feeling both incomplete and overstuffed. If it wants to introduce this many characters, it needs more runtime. If it cuts some characters, it still needs to be longer to bring every other subplot to an end.  That said, the technical elements here are very good with terrific costume design, production design, and makeup/hairstyling. All are pitch perfect and perfectly capture the 1800s England feel with the correct importance and weight to the sets. The film is also well paced, even if the story does not deliver fully.

Pretty funny at times, The Men Who Stare at Goats manages to be a satire that takes itself a touch too seriously and goes a little too deep into the \""bad weird\"" territory for me, in that it goes weird, but is not funny in doing so, just weird. At those moments, this one is off-putting. However, luckily, the moments where it is some quality satire and quite funny outnumber them. Also in the \""pro\"" corner for this one is the great cast. I really liked George Clooney and Ewan McGregor here. Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey were not quite as good, but still turned in assured performances here. Ultimately, the moments where this one struggles mightily is when it takes itself too seriously and thinks it is being truly profound. As I said, these moments are not many when compared to the strong scenes, but those strong scenes are also short of being great.

Hearkening back to his 1980s science fiction adventure fantasy work in Time Bandits, Brazil, or the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus takes audiences on a magical adventure to a world never quite seen before. Guided by an old man, his daughter, little person assistant, and a young guy, this journey is one that has all the right moments of Gilliam's classics and touches on very similar themes to those films from his \""Trilogy of Imagination\"", but never really comes together. The film lacks that \""it\"" factor and a sense of cohesion to make it all come together as a strong work that brings Gilliam's career back to the quality of his peak and not just the same feeling of whimsy. In essence, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus looks, sounds, and acts like a Terry Gilliam film directed by somebody inspired by Gilliam, not the director himself."", ""In a similar fashion to Time Bandits, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is consistently focused upon the concept of good and evil. Depicting Satan via the three-piece suit wearing Mr. Nick (Tom Waits) and positioning Doctor Parnassus as a monk committed to saving people, the film shows the two competing for souls throughout the film that has led to many bets. One such bet resulted in Parnassus' daughter Valentina (Lily Cole) being given to Mr. Nick when she turns 16 and with her birthday a few days away, Doctor Parnassus is in his final hours of trying to save her. When a mysterious stranger, Tony (Heath Ledger), is found hanging on a bridge that Parnassus and his gang were passing over, the opportunity to win back Valentina arises. Given a final bet - first to five souls gets Valentina - and having to rely on Tony to help win over the five he needs, Doctor Parnassus must change his show to win over the five souls and rely upon Tony far more than he should to be able to do so."", ""Inside the Imaginarium, visitors and possible souls are given a choice between good and evil, essentially. Operating with similar themes to Gilliam's Trilogy of Imagination, these choices can often be represented via materialism, promiscuity, or any other temptations. For example, a group of women enter the Imaginarium and to be able to receive self-fulfillment - which is the good path offered by Parnassus - they must shed their wealthy jewelry and accessories. Yet, the path to self-fulfillment is a challenging one. Visualized by having participants climb an incredibly tall set of stone stairs, the option is not one for the weak hearted. Given the challenge, the possibility of \""easy ignorance\"" and fleeting fulfillment offered by Mr. Nick - in one trip, it is visualized as a motel run by Mr. Nick called the \""One Nite Stand Motel\"" -  can become impeccably appealing to those unwilling to make the arduous journey to fulfillment. The path chooses ultimately decides who gets their soul for the rest of eternity and, as a result, is a vital decision one must make when they enter the Imaginarium."", ""With this temptation taking center stage in this battle for souls, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus shows the dangers of giving into temptation and earthly pleasures instead of seeking fulfillment through some benevolent being. Imaginative in this pursuit, Gilliam never really innovates on ideas he previously presented, but nonetheless, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a film so outside of the box in conception that it is hard to find fault. The film's commitment to showing the perils of choosing riches and spoils on Earth is one that even impacts its protagonist and is a strong message, no matter how prevalent of an idea it is in Gilliam's work. The different approach offered in this film and the film's refusal to let anybody off the hook or to avoid their true nature is admirable, demonstrating Gilliam's dedication to show how to find some measure of morality in an inherently immoral - demonstrated via the bars and seedy clubs the troupe operates in - world."", ""However, where the film slips up is in the creation of its world and its themes. It has the beats, the feeling, and imagination, of all of Gilliam's films, but lacks the soul and the heart. It feels too haphazardly slapped together and clearly bore the brunt of its production problems regarding Ledger's death. It never feels like a cohesive work, instead operating as a film that has a set idea on what it wants to be and how it wants to look, but never really figured out how to make either work or how to make it all come together as an enjoyable film. Rather, it often feels incessantly frantic. Rushing through everything and simultaneously dragging - a tough feeling to describe or really create as a filmmaker - The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus has all the bells and whistles, but never really clicks or has the whimsical soul"" ]";5

Aside from Bridges, the acting is good, but Crazy Heart's narrative formula is tried and true. While conventional, it is a good take on the music \""biopic\"" formula and is a thoroughly entertaining film, heartbreaking at times, plus it has great music.

1767;the-secret-in-their-eyes;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""An intense crime film, The Secret in Their Eyes is incredibly dark, thrilling, and smart. Often times, mystery crime films can sort of go through the motions. There is a murder and a detective sets off to find out who committed the crime. There are clues, there are red herrings, and then the predictable ending arrives. It is the equivalent of watching a crime show on CBS that is shown on Thursday nights. Yet, this Argentinian crime film is any but that sort of film. Instead, it is a smart film that creates political parallels and crafts a compelling tale of revenge, punishment, and pain. Instead of relying upon the crime, the crime merely serves as a spring board into deeper and more purposeful explorations."", ""Remade in 2015, I have not seen the remake, but it is clear that it is very different than this film. Starting with the brutal rape and murder of a woman, Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo), the film introduces our detective: Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin). Writing a novel about the case 25 years after it happened, Esposito is a man who has never let go of this case. After the convicted killer escaped his clutches, Esposito continues to track him while forging an never-to-be romance with his boss, Irene (Soledad Vallamil). Along the way, he interacts with Liliana's widowed husband, Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago). As the film likely indicates through the title, the eyes are very important, as well as passion. A thing a person is passionate is something they can never let go. This is a major focus of the film, with much of the story being told through the eyes. Irene and Benjamin are passionate about one another and can never let each go, no matter how much time has passed. Ricardo is passionate about Liliana and cannot let her go as he seeks revenge for his wife's brutal death. The murderer is passionate about Liliana. These passions are through the eyes with Ricardo identifying the killer because of the look in his eyes in a photo and he can tell Ricardo's passion and anger simply by looking into his eyes. Here, the film is incredibly smart and really takes to the heart the belief that the eyes are the window to the soul."", ""One of the best features of the film, however, is the way in which it does not focus on the crime. By the halfway point, we know the killer. Yet, the film continues to have tricks up its sleeves and keeps you guessing all the way to the end. By the time the film ends, it leaves you shocked with its subtle brutality and the horrifying nightmare experienced by its character. The story here is really in the details and require complete attention throughout to be able to follow all of the moving parts. Thus, it is a film that would certainly benefit from a rewatch in order to pick up on all of these intricacies. Using a color-palette of browns, golds, and some grays, The Secret in Their Eyes feels both warm and passionate. Campanella uses the connotations of these colors to create a haunting atmosphere that feels omnipresent in the film and never really ceases. Though brown is typically a color of comfort, he uses it in such a way that nothing ever feels comfortable. Esposito walking to a crime scene or in the house leaves you with great anxiety, even if browns are a major color in these moments. At the very least, these colors work very well together the film is incredibly appealing to the eyes. With this great blend of colors, the film captures the nostalgic and melancholy nature of the film as Esposito is filled with regret over his love life and the crime, with nostalgia for a time when he had Irene and could have had a life with her."", ""Acting-wise, the film is equally terrific. Darin turns in a great performance in the lead role, capturing the stolid nature of his character as well as the internal tormented soul. As the film focuses on the eyes, his eyes are great here and really reveal the true nature of his character. Pablo Rago is also great in a smaller role here as he captures the depression and passion of Morales, the widowed husband.

Haunting, tragic, and thrilling, the film uses a great color scheme to create an odd warmth for its tale of passion. Exceeding the trappings of the crime mystery genre, the film never plays it safe and instead rises above cliches and keeps you guessing throughout.

Though director Spike Jonze obviously incorporates all elements from the book, he instills his own world view and experiences upon the book. The end result is a truly passionate and stirring look at childhood and a young boy dealing with many issues (abandonment, lack of empathy, etc) but through his interactions with these beasts, he learns how to improve himself. Impressively scripted and told, Where the Wild Things Are is a truly imaginative and inspired take on Maurice Sendak's famed children's book. That said, it is likely not a children's movie. A few sequences are quite scary and the amount of adult emotion and reflections on childhood will likely go over many children's heads. That said, I loved this one. The star here is Spike Jonze who really crafts a truly personal film here and this is quite apparent in his gentle handling of the film. Overall, though not a children's movie, Where the Wild Things Are is a very good realization of a staple of many's childhood."" ]";5

I am not a huge fan of John Hillcoat's, but his direction here is good as usual and he really manages to tell quite the beautiful and tragic story here. Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee are phenomenal. Robert Duvall, Charlize Theron, Michael K. Williams, Guy Pearce, and Molly Parker, all have very small roles here, but all are good in their roles and really make the film all the more tragic. Unrelentingly bleak, the worst (best?) part of this one is how it will give you a glimmer of hope from time to time and then it just rips your heart out again and steps on it. This makes the somewhat hopeful ending, almost depressing, since you know the positive will not last forever. This one is gorgeously filmed and it really shows how much beauty there is, even when things are going bad. Each shot, with its largely gray and bleak colorization, is breathtaking and, for me, is the true star of this film. While the acting is great, the cinematography is the true powerhouse here. The story is also solid, even if bleak. As a whole, the end result for this film is pretty good. It is not an amazing film, but it is most certainly powerful, beautiful, tragic, and filled with despair, all of which make it one that is tough to watch, but make for a good watch all the same."" ]";5

Tense and thrilling, there are rarely films nowadays that leave me on the edge of my seat, but Green Zone made me think I was going to have a heart attack - it was that thrilling and energizing. The film, politically, has been criticized as \""anti-American\"". I am not seeing it. If anything, it is pro-understanding. Those who try to learn more instead of sticking their head in the sand are rewarded. Those who put down dissenters are villains. That said, the film's simple point of, only Iraqis should run Iraq is very well built up to and a fair point.

Yet, somehow it pulls if off surprisingly well, turning its slow and character-driven first half into an enjoyable diversion from the high stakes drama surrounding the looming presence of Voldemort. By the time the film finally jumps into the central battle of the series, director David Yates is able to deliver the goods with a thrilling, rousing, and powerful, climax that is smartly low-scale and content with being just a cog in the whole wheel. As a result, the Half-Blood Prince manages to take the story where Order of the Phoenix left off and set it up perfectly for the finale of this beloved series. Though not necessarily a great stand-alone work due to how much it relies upon the other films to have a story that makes any sense, it nonetheless works incredibly well in context, being one of the most pleasant and filled-with-wonder entries in the series since Prisoner of Azkaban changed the tone entirely."", ""For the first half of the film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince operates like a soap opera version of itself entitled Harry Potter and the Horny Teenagers.

Of course it is Ginny though, those two are meant for each other! I wonder what will happen with that weird blonde girl though? Do I smell a second love triangle? In this game of musical chairs and hot potato that is teenage relationship, the Half-Blood Prince seems fully invested in divulging every single detail. Ironically, while this is exactly what I dislike about the series at times - too much focus on items that do not matter - it works here quite nicely. It is funny, cute, and oddly endearing as we watch them go through the works of teenage relationships. It is a reminder of their youth in the face of the horrors and challenges they must face in fighting Voldemort. As a brief calm before the storm that will come in the Deathly Hallows, the Half-Blood Prince makes this feel like the final summer before they all head off to college, likely to not see one another again. In this, the bittersweet and nostalgic charm is hard to deny as incredibly fun to watch."", ""By the time the film settles into its second half, the Half-Blood Prince makes good on the suggestions and hints regarding who the Half-Blood Prince could be with a tension-filled and atmospheric finale. As Dumbledore and Harry go into the cave, it feels like a last stand for an old gunslinger in a western and, as with that, it comes with every bit of the tension and anticipation. Featuring a chilling sequence of these humanoid creatures jumping out of the water and Dumbledore having to use fire against them, the scene is one with excellent production design and strong direction David Yates. After building up some tension regarding this locale and biding his time the whole film, Yates manages to make the whole wait worthwhile, while not over-exerting this film into becoming another grand battle between Voldemort and Harry. Instead, as a minor battle as part of the larger war, the Half-Blood Prince manages to be thrilling in its own right without stealing any thunder from the concluding journey. A poignant death and memorial sequence only furthers the film's accomplishments with powerful staging of the memorial and deeply compelling possibilities about where Snape's loyalty may in fact lie. Is he still a death-eater or is he working for the order as an informant? Smartly, the Half-Blood Prince leaves this mystery open, making the Deathly Hallows a film that is hard to not highly anticipate."", ""As always, the Half-Blood Prince is often quite beautiful look at with Yates' camera often finding truly stunning images, especially in the cave or in the aerial shot of the memorial. While this series is seriously milking those shots of the valley in the sunrise, it is hard to deny that it is not beautiful all the same. These Harry Potter films often use their special effects in the perfect way to create a beautiful shot and the Half-Blood Prince is no exception to that fact. Where the film falters, however, is often in the over-reliance on cuts. When Harry is attacked by the humanoid creatures in the cave, Yates' camera cuts repeatedly without moving Harry or actually showing anything. He just falls back, cuts, and then he is in a slightly different place an inch to the left. With about 10 cuts in a millisecond in this sequence, it is borderline headache-inducing. The same then occurs as Harry talks to Hermione in the castle with the camera desperately needing a fidget spinner to keep still. Spinning around, cutting, and changing angles"" ]";5

Essentially a film about people discovering that life is largely meaningless and that delusions keep us happy and willing to move on, the film is pretty bleak and cynical. Starring an ensemble cast of Naomi Watts, Josh Brolin, Anthony Hopkins, Gemma Jones, Antonio Banderas, Lucy Punch, and Freida Pinto, the film's plot is pretty simple. Getting older, a woman's husband leaves her for a call girl in search of meaning and youth. To cope, she begins to meet with a fortune teller. Though those around her tell her that it is not real, she begins to believe in reincarnation and that she will soon meet a \""tall dark stranger\"". By the end of the film, it becomes clear she was the smart one."", ""Some could interpret this film as slightly anti-religion. Surely, many have declared that religion is merely a delusion. As Allen is an atheist and he has even put religion on the level of fortune tellers, this angle certainly makes sense. Yet, this is simplistic. If anything, Allen is encouraging people to \""delude\"" themselves by believing whatever they want to make themselves happy. While Helena Shepridge (Gemma Jones) is left by her husband, distraught, and lost, she is the only happy character at the end. Meeting a man, Jonathan (Roger Ashton-Griffiths), who owns an Occult bookstore and believes in reincarnation as well, Helena is finally happy after a long time. Their mutual delusions and belief in reincarnation and the power of fortune tellers has left them deeply in love and satisfied with their lives. This cannot be said for any character who has given into lust via the marrying of call girls, leaving their spouses, full-on adultery, are failures, are devious, or just deeply unhappy. Turns out that if they just went to the fortune teller as well, their lives would have been far happier and more fulfilling."", ""Aside from Helena, everybody else suffers from incredible strife in their lives, but possibly none more than Roy Channing (Josh Brolin). Married to Sally (Naomi Watts), who wants to have sex without contraception in order to have a child, Roy is struggling. He does not want to have a child and is set to give into lust and learn that the grass is always greener on the other side. Or, in his case, the girl is always hotter through the window. A one-hit wonder in the literature world, Roy cannot write anymore and keeps turning out books nobody wants to publish. So, he opts to steal the book of his dead friend and claim it as his own, which of course raises problems when the friend is not dead. He also leaves his wife for Dia (Freida Pinto) because he thought she looked hot through the window. Sadly for Roy, the film ends with him seeing Sally through the window and coming to the realization that she too is attractive. Poor Roy. All self-inflicted of course, but he was one of the most ardent opposers of the fortune teller for Helena. Moral of the story here? Find what makes you happy and do not pick at it. Alfie (Anthony Hopkins), the husband of Helena, suffers from this when he marries a call girl and then wants to get back together with Helena when he realizes she is not a great wife. Roy and Alfie both picked at their happiness is search of something more and to pursue a path they were not meant to pursue. They refused to go with the flow and now wind up as two of the most unhappy characters in the film. In many ways, they tried to live out a life that Allen, at the beginning and end of the film, has already declared is meaningless. If life is pointless, it is better to delude yourself into believing something instead of pursuing meaning and purpose. If you do pursue it, it will leave you lacking anything."", ""Of course, You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger is a very philosophical and existential film. Many of Woody's films are and this one is no exception. Yet, it is very fleeting. It drops tid bits of opinions and philosophies and then scurries away. It is not nearly as funny or impactful as his best works and is, at worst, a largely forgettable experience. Within a few weeks, it is likely that this film will escape my mind. Though invariably a good time and some easy, but smart, watching, You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger is one that only Woody Allen fans should really opt to watch. For those who are not a fan of the guy, this film will really, really suck. Fortunately, his cynicism and existentialism are always incredibly watchable and with great actors doing their thing in a Woody Allen film, this one will never be a totally irredeemable watch. As a whole, the film is flawed, but its story is so engrossing, so odd, and its actors so good, it is hard to look away from."" ]";5

Sporting fantastic special effects and creature design, Monsters may be a touch underwhelming on the monster front, but director Gareth Edwards knows how to create tension and an unsettling atmosphere to the point that when the monsters arrive, you are ready to burst with fear and excitement. The acting is solid and, as I said, the direction and special effects are top-notch. Where Monsters somewhat falls apart is with the human characters, brief moments of trying to give them some depth, and an entirely useless romantic tension throughout the film. Honestly, it serves no purpose. I want to watch these creatures cause havoc, not watch two poorly crafted characters ignore the obvious sexual tension in the room.

Naomi Watts is very good in the lead role while Sean Penn is perfectly cast as her ambassador husband. Together, they have great chemistry that adds an air of authenticity to this film about a very important topic. Additionally, the film can be a truly entertaining political thriller that never gets too complicated, which can be a problem encountered by many a political thriller. Instead, this one showcases director Doug Liman's trademarks (using TV footage prominently) and mastery of the spy/political genre.

Yet, its thematic indulgences make the film a worthwhile piece to further examine. Telling the story of a famed Hollywood actor, Somewhere explores the distance he feels with the rest of the world, the claustrophobia induced by his stardom, and the unexpected bond he forms with his daughter. With top-notch acting, good direction, and solid writing, Somewhere is a film that may not be the most entertaining work ever released, but is still a smart assessment on the topics it addresses."", ""In terms of stardom, the film largely explores how trapped our protagonist, Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff), is by his fame. Stuck in a life of casual sex that he appears to be disenchanted with and has proven unfruitful, Johnny is wisked from location-to-location in order to promote his latest work. One such occasion finds him sent to make a mold of his face for the special effects department. Trapped in a seat for 40 minutes as the mold sets, the film's greatest exploration of its thematic dealings comes in this sequence. Physically showing how trapped he is by his now unwanted life, Johnny is then confronted by an older version of himself, courtesy of the terrific special effects team. Seeing himself as an old man in the mirror, Johnny is confronted by the path he is headed towards, should he not make an adjustment in his present course. Dorff really brings this element to life by being largely unconnected. Emotionless and distant when being whisked from Los Angeles to Milan for a television show and some interviews, Johnny Marco is certainly a man who is feeling deeply unfulfilled, in spite of his seemingly perfect life."", ""What really drives home his dissatisfaction is his relationship with his daughter Cleo (Elle Fanning). Left with him by his ex-wife who runs off to have some alone time, Johnny truly begins to bond with his daughter. With her at his side, he finally begins to feel happy and satisfied. While this drives him closer to the edge - especially after she leaves for summer camp - it also allows him to confront his demons. By the end of the film, we see him up and leave his past life and embark on a new journey. Even more, we see him cope with the loneliness forced upon him with Cleo's departure. We see how unhappy he is without her and this awakens an element of being a parent with him, which was previously non-existent. These thematic explorations are terrifically handled in the film by director Sofia Coppola who gives her characters room to breathe and emote in their own unique way."", ""Of course, credit must be given to both Dorff and Fanning. Together, the duo has great chemistry and truly makes you believe they are father and daughter. Their relationship has an authenticity and overt bonding element that really makes you feel the impact their new found friendship has had on the two of them. Also a credit to the writing, as these two are very developed, even if there is a limit to the depth and amount of \""fleshing out\"" given to any character in the film. As, essentially, a slice of life film, Somewhere rarely delves into what got these characters here and only shows us their present. This really does give a limited scope in our understanding of these people, though the film endeavors to try and fill us in as much as possible."", ""That said, this lack of depth really does hurt when it comes to how engaging the film truly is and its impact upon the viewer. With the lack of a past for anybody, the film truly lacks the feel of culmination. As we did not get to see their entire journey, the ending feels flat almost and not a hard fought victory after years of turmoil and toiling in self-loathing. The film itself is also poorly paced for much of it, with the impact of leaving the viewer desperately clawing at something to hang onto. For many, this manifested itself in a disdain for the protagonist, due to his distant and privileged lifestyle. Myself, I never felt any disdain. However, it did lack an element that could have made the film more relatable and, therefore, impactful."", ""As a whole, Somewhere is a good look at parenthood and troubles with stardom. However, a lack of relatability and the remarkable distance between the characters and the audience leaves the film feeling entirely hollow and unfulfilling. That said, its thematic elements are terrific and Coppola does a great job exploring and managing these elements."" ]";5

The film's emotional high notes are entirely heartbreaking and watching Steven Russell destroy both his life and that of the man he loves, can be truly hard to watch, though ever entertaining given the comedic approach to the film. Overall, I Love You Phillip Morris has pretty indistinct direction and is not nearly as funny as it thinks it is, but all of this is alright in my book due to its highs.

1783;salt;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Possibly one of the dumber movies I have ever seen. Yet, it is undeniably entertaining. For a first half that seems so compelling to only turn into a film where Angelina Jolie jumps from one truck to another on the highway as if they were just rocks in a stream is stunning. This is absolutely one of those films that asks you to just accept the fact that this girl is capable of literally anything or move on and watch a different film. Your enjoyment of the film is entirely reliant upon whether or not you will accept the logical leaps and gaps this film makes. Personally, this change is quite disappointing as the film becomes shockingly stupid and formulaic in the second half, but if you look past its dumb exterior, you will find that its interior is just as stupid. A case study in how being dumb does not make a movie bad, director Phillip Noyce's film is a thrilling film featuring Angelina Jolie kicking the **** out of people for an hour and a half."", ""Salt, if nothing else, proves that women in CIA super agent roles are not immune to being heavily objectified in a film. No matter how many people she takes down, the film goes to great lengths to **** Jolie's character of Evelyn Salt. From an initial scene where Jolie is dragged out in her bra and panties to be interrogated by the North Koreans to a later scene where she takes off her panties to block a camera, only to later sit in a cab with her legs apread, Salt continuously sexualizes her character. For a film that shows just how fierce she is, the film - as Mulvey would note - continues to play into the two roles for a woman in film: castrator and child-rearer. By highlighting her femininity and vagina, Salt highlights her lack of a penis and plays up that child-rearing possibility through not-so-subtle suggestion. With scenes of her beating men up and emasculating them by having them get easily taken down by a woman, Salt establishes her as a castrator capable of stealing the pride from any opposing male force she encounters."", ""That said, while the film plays into typical sexist traits of film, so do many films.  Otherwise, it is just a rather straight forward action flick. Featuring Jolie as Evelyn Salt, a top-notch CIA agent with a husband and dog that is accused by an apparent Russian defector of being a sleeper agent set to assassinate the Russian President, the film initially toes the line quite nicely. Is she really Russian or is she playing for the Americans all along? Creating suspense and mystery around this subject, Noyce embraces both identities equally, leaving clues as to the truth in small actions she takes before making a run for it to try and rescue her kidnapped husband. This all mostly comes in the first half, which is definitely the stronger of the two halves of the film. Stylish, relatively smart, and well-staged, this section shows Noyce's grasp of how to create a spell-binding spy film that keeps its secrets tucked close to its chest."", ""However, the second half unfortunately becomes not just entirely stupid and implausible, but entirely cliche. From unsurprising reveals to a rather typical nuclear Russia and sleeper agent plot that seems more at home during the Cold War than the modern day, Salt plays on anxieties regarding Russia and never really makes them feel original. The Russians here are just run-of-the-mill European bad guys who may hide in plain sight, but need a lesson in how to not be so obviously Russian while still undercover. Ending with a greatly nuclear scene in a bunker under the White House - which inexplicably has a side room next to the safe room with a see-through bulletproof mirror (I have no idea why the safe room for the President has this room) - before we see Evelyn and the new chief bad guy do karate kicks at one another, the scene simultaneously shows the two sides of Salt. On one hand, we have the silliness of it all, compounded by cliches (omg the command is at 99%, but here she comes!). On the other, the excellent fight choreography, tension, and general spectacle of it all that makes the film oh so entertaining to watch."", ""While perhaps not the most well-thought out action movie ever made, Salt is still terrific fun. Well made and thoroughly thrilling throughout, Salt shows that when Angelina Jolie is given a gun and tasked with shooting or kicking anybody that comes near her, she is really in her element. Plus, who could not love another modern action movie that blatantly sets up a sequel and, as of yet, has not received one with no word on a sequel in five years? This should be a new subgenre: films that setup a sequel that will apparently never be made."" ]";5

In addition to their general acting ability, director John Wells does a good job making us feel compassion for the three highly privileged characters and turns them into really tragic figures for a variety of reasons. Additionally, the story has been called mundane, but to me, it was very briskly paced and never really slacked. It did a good job generating drama and, honestly, thrills, as you waited to see what occurred in certain scenes.

Edgar Wright's style is very abrasive here, since he basically just made it a video game/comic book that was made into a movie, but it really has a very cool and unique look to it that really made the film true eye candy at times.

While, as I said, the ending falters a touch by being a little too neat, the proceeding hour and a half is so good, it is easy to look past that given the well executed premise that will continue to thrill you in and of itself for the entire runtime."" ]";5

Throughout the film, I could not help but marvel at Firth's amazing performance and he really caries this one on his shoulders. Beyond him, the film is a very nice period drama with pitch perfect art and costume direction that really define the era that is covered here. Geoffrey Rush also did a very good job here, though I cannot help but think he almost got overshadowed by Firth's powerhouse performance in the lead role. The film also does a good job making us feel sympathy for the King as he struggles with this debilitating speech impediment that prevents him from being able to speak to his nation as he should."", """", ""In terms of negatives, this one has a couple which prevent me from giving it a higher score. First off, it is incredibly slow. The final 15-20 minutes are gold and exactly what we are waiting for, but, while everything before certainly has its moments, it certainly drags a fair bit. I was never bored, but it was troublesome to say the least. Also, this one does not strike me as a film with a lot of replay value. I watched it and now what? If this one is on television or what not, I do not really envision myself stopping and having to watch it again. Regardless, it is quite a good film and it is not hard to see why it did so well at the Oscars."" ]";5
1788;water-for-elephants;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A stylish period piece that doubles as a mushy and sweet forbidden love affair, Water for Elephants is mostly set on a train. Holding the Benzini Bros Circus as run by a man named August Rosenbluth (Christoph Waltz), this train is also where veterinarian Jacob (Robert Pattinson) meets August's beautiful wife and star attraction Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). Using a set-up similar to The Notebook with the story of this love affair book-ended with scenes of Jacob telling the story as an old man (Hal Holbrook), Water for Elephants is a visually splendid tale of forbidden love that blends both affair film tropes with male savior tropes and, finally, with soul mate tropes. The final blending of this comes together into a film that may be quite stereotypical and predictable in the end, but is a charmer nonetheless and puts on quite the show."", ""In recent times, I have come to find a lot of films fall into this \""Dual-Risk Love Affair\"" trope in which two people meet and begin some type of scandalous relationship in which they risk not just being caught, but losing their place in society. These love affairs are short lived and they are broken apart by circumstances and rejected by the communities in which the lovers reside. Yet, during their time together, one location or a series of locations wind up defining their love. That said, the most definitive elements of this are films that have that \""dual-risk\"". This forbidden affair must be hidden due to spouses or society knowing, but also fear of blowback that seems them lose their spots in the world. Water for Elephants' central romance certainly falls into this group of films with an affair taking center stage that is risky due to August finding out. Violently rejecting the love thanks to his goons, August finding out would see Jacob tossed out of the train and out of the only world he really knows after the death of his parents. As such, for Jacob, he risks life and limb to be with Marlena, with their love being defined by the circus and their love of animals. As with other films in this \""subgenre\"" of sorts, Water for Elephants derives romantic tension not just from the forbidden nature of their love, but what it would mean if they were discovered and how it would impact their livelihoods. However, the key is undoubtedly the series of \""brief encounters\"" they share with one another. A momentary dance, bonding over their love of animals, running away from the cops and sharing a kiss, or celebrating Jacob joining the circus, Water for Elephants' love is defined in a series of moments where the two lovers are allowed to embrace their love. Dripping with romantic chemistry between Pattinson and Witherspoon, these moments where they can throw caution into the wind and share a passionate kiss are the real highlight of this romance. The scenes radiate and, for anyone around them, there is no question as to their love for one another. It is a love that is built out of small moments together that grows into something so much more."", ""While the inherent soul mate nature to that love is gloriously defined and as swoon-inducing as one comes to expect from a romantic film, one hitch in the film is definitely the male savior element. With August being abusive, animal hating, and money hungry, he meets all of the requirements to being a man that has a woman who needs to be \""saved\"". Telling Marlena that she is beautiful and deserves a beautiful life, Jacob embarks on a journey to save her from a \""bad boy\"" and show her what a \""nice guy\"" can do for her. In essence, he is a white knight and she is his damsel in distress. The film's full embrace of this narrative is certainly disappointing to see unfold and really adds an unnecessary \""male savior\"" element to the film that somewhat undermines the beautiful romance is develops in other scenes. It adds tension, sure, but this tension is always a bit silly and leads to coaxing an elephant into an unlikely murder of a man. The climax is mostly maligned with this, leaving the film ending a very sour note in terms of practicality and how cliche its tension had become."", ""Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto is admittedly the star here though. The man behind the camera for 21 Grams, Brokeback Mountain, Babel, Silence, and Passengers, Prieto is a man who knows how to create striking images. Water for Elephants is no exception with a classic-appearing film that is consistently beautifully lit with vibrant colors that really explode onto the screen. This style not only complements the romance on display, but paints a vivid picture of this 1930s lifestyle on the train. From the drab sequences when they are all poor and struggling to eat to the scenes of joy and celebration that are popping with color when they are on top, Prieto has a keen eye for how to create a shot that both embodies the mood and augments that mood to create an image that really invokes feeling and style."" ]";5

A bit more vulgar and adult than other animated films, much of the film is incredibly derivative of old westerns (especially Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, as well as an homage to Depp's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) and as such, it may not really be the thing most kids want to see. Regardless, it does manage to be uproariously funny at times and had me in stitches at a few times. The voice cast, including Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, and Timothy Olyphant, is splendid and really knocks the ball out of the park.

I did not expect that going in and while I knew some of what was discussed, it was still very cool to see it come to life in a film. In terms of the story itself, the film was very cute and charming as we follow the events that transpire for this kid living in the train station. The acting was also pretty good. There were moments when I had to pause and take in how bad they were, but for the most part, they did a solid job for being child actors. Ben Kingsley also turned in a reliably good performance."", """", ""On the negative side, there is not much, but the aforementioned times when the acting was...less than sub-par. In those moments, it took me out of the film a bit. In addition, in the beginning, it is a tad hard to get into. However, once you are in, you are in for good.

It is not hard to believe that this was a personal situation for writer/director Mike Mills, evident in his graceful direction and fantastic script. The dialogue and characterizations feel thoroughly real and well-executed. Ewan McGregor, Melanie Laurent, and Christopher Plummer, all turn in very good performances here and real human beings with real emotions. It is always refreshing to see a film that treats the human condition with such respect and extracts drama from everyday life. Beginners is a perfect example of this and this, in turn, makes it a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience.

The action sequences are well done and the story is told very well. The mockumentary style used at times was very unique and an interesting way of setting everything up. In addition, the special effects are stellar. The spaceships, weapons, and aliens, are brilliantly crafted and beautiful to watch. The story is very well written as well and the amount of emotion here is very nice and adds a layer of depth to the sci-fi action flick that this one is. My only concerns here are the, at times, excessive gore, which I am never a fan of and the inclusion of the Nigerians. I can see why the Nigerians took offense, but my personal concern is that it was very over the top and unsettling in a bad way, not a good unsettling, if that makes sense. Overall, District 9 is a very well made and acted science fiction film that has me looking forward to a possible sequel."" ]";5

PLEASE DO NOT IRON YOUR HANDS, FRIEND. HELL YES YOU ARE A FREE ELF."", ""OH MY GOD NO NOT DOBBY TOO. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO KILL DOBBY?!"", ""A truly traumatic watch, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 compounds the trauma of killing of Gary Oldman a few movies back by killing three of the other great parts they had going for it. Beyond writing out Kenneth Branagh's insanely narcissistic teacher, under-utilizing Alan Rickman throughout, and seemingly forgetting they have Emma Thompson as a professor, this entry may be the most egregious in killing off writing out the best characters. The worst part is it does this all while letting Ron's teenage angst and jealousy get so out of control that he storms off and ditches the mission that he fully understood would be difficult half-way through. Why kill of Gleeson, Oldman, Nighy, and Dobby, and under-utilize Rickman, Thompson, Branagh, and even John Hurt, if Ron is still allowed to live? Really missed major opportunities in the name of keeping this kid around."", ""As the set-up to the final film and, by extension, the final showdown between Harry and Lord Voldemort, Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows packs a considerable amount of menace throughout, in large due to the excellent opening. As Voldemort kills a hostage and then attacks the Order as they move Harry to a safe location, the film starts off on an incredibly thrilling note. With beautiful special effects as they change into all looking like Harry, great mid-air duels, and a gorgeous combination of Voldemort and Harry's wands fending one another off, the opening of this seventh film is perhaps the best yet in the series. Without meandering or bothering to slow down the pace, the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 drops us right back in the wizarding world and dares us to keep up as it weaves its tale. Starting with its foot on the gas and never letting up - aside from the scenes in the woods to some degree - this first entry into the Deathly Hallows novel is menacing, thrilling, and one that has you constantly looking over your shoulder for Voldemort."", ""Combining this tension with a great central mystery regarding both the horcruxes and the deathly hallows, the film really ramps up the tension nicely. Perhaps the greatest touch is one yet to come in how this introduction of the deathly hallows ties in Harry's invisibility cloak. As the trio of friends traverse the country side in search of these horcruxes, the film really builds up the stakes nicely as they race with Voldemort to find them all and to find all items in the deathly hallows. That said, where the film really trips up is the ending. Showing Voldemort taking the  wand from the deathly hallows out of Dumbledore's grave, it really begs the question: who the hell thought the MOST POWERFUL WAND IN THE WIZARDING WORLD would be safe being buried with a dead guy? Did nobody foresee Voldemort just walking on over, exhuming the grave, and then just taking the wand? At this point, Snape playing both sides is hardly the main issue at hand. The issue is the sheer incompetency of the Order of the Phoenix."", ""While the sequences in the woods can often drag, they provide some great character development and shore up the bond between the central trio very nicely. After Ron is  manipulated by a horcrux and storms off, Harry tries to cheer up Hermione by dancing with her. Perhaps a superfluous scene to the plot, the sequence nonetheless really brings a smile to your face and shows the connection between the two. Coming right off the heals of Hermione resting her head on Harry's shoulder as he visits his parent's grave for the first time, the two moments show the emotional connection that goes well beyond the events the two are experiencing at the moment. Powerful and moving to watch, these two moments show the growth of these characters into caring young adults who truly love one another and, above all else, want their friends to be happy and safe. These moments are very nicely acted and brought to life by director David Yates, who gives them just the right amount of emotional charge."", ""As in all of the films, Yates gives the film some great imagery along the way. One such shot is one of Ron and Hermione skipping stones in the background with Harry in the foreground. Beautifully framed and a tranquil moment amid the chaos of the impending war, the shot highlights the sheer beauty this series has been able to create at times. The aforementioned combination of Voldemort and Harry's wand beams coming together always serves as a beautiful shot earlier in the film. One of the highlights of the visuals, however, comes when Harry finds the sword of Gryffindor."" ]";5
1794;black-swan;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Darren Aronofsky is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors and Black Swan is a shining example of why that is happening. Here, he crafts a film that perfectly fits the bill of \""psychological thriller\"" as this one is absolutely terrifying at times, but always leaves you searching for answers as you are never quite certain what exactly happened. Throughout, we follow the clearly disturbed Nina, played by Natalie Portman, who absolutely kills it here. Her descent into madness is beautifully constructed and portrayed by Aronofsky as it almost makes us feel as though we are going insane right along with her. Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel also have good supporting roles here. The only thing against this one was that it was a little slow going in the beginning, however, once it really kicks in high gear, it is completely engrossing as you follow every twist and turn and try to wrap your head around what you just watched. This film is certainly jarring and is \""perfect\"", just as Nina would want. Really, this one deserves all of the plaudits it received and really lived up to the hype for me."" ]";5

Shannon does a great job portraying this troubled man. The writing here is also very good and it does a great job drawing connections between the storms, both exterior and interior. Overall, I would say this film has many strengths, but none that make it a truly great film. As it stands, it is pretty good, but is missing that \""it\"" factor. Its main negative is that it is a touch too long, even though it is two hours. Some scenes could have been cut and the final result would have been just as effective. However, as it stands, the film shows both the talents of Nichols and Shannon quite well and show is a pretty emotionally impactful film."" ]";5

While not as challenging of its racial elements as it should be and built on the trope of an educated white person helping minorities, The Help rises above these conventions with a truly heartfelt and triumphant story. Even more, the acting lifts the film into a different stratosphere. Led by Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Emma Stone, and Jessica Chastain, The Help is a real showcase for its actors who all steal the show in their own ways. Additionally, the film is really well paced. For a film that is two and a half hours, it never slacked and had no filler. Instead, it is a well cut and well paced film that never really slowed down, instead providing entertainment for the entire runtime.

It is also very well directed and makes good use of its found footage approach, which is actually used quite uniquely with many different cameras and people behind the camera being utilized, which allowed us to get a variety of perspectives. The first hour of this film is very good and incredibly engaging as this group of friends begins to learn what they can and cannot do with their newly discovered superpowers. However, that last half hour was horrendous and nearly ruined the entire film. Everything really hits the fan here and the film veers violently off-course, which is really too bad as it was really good beforehand. The film, instead of being a fun superhero kind of film, instead becomes a journey into the mind of the mind of a truly broken kid. This really hurt the overall tone of the film and disappointed me since it was just poorly handled and over-the-top. Overall, Chronicle when from being good to being nothing more than slightly above average."" ]";5

A twist on the haunted house story with an explanation and backstory, The Woman in Black features a very good performance from Daniel Radcliffe, as well as a good one from Ciaran Hinds. The production design is great and greatly contributes to the great atmosphere created by the film that really unsettles you. In regards to the twist, there is a great scene where we get a POV shot from the ghosts perspective as we finally see her take on things and why everything is happening, which is really interesting. The ending is a little odd and I cannot tell if it is touching or terrifying. Regardless, The Woman In Black is really well done and very much a terrifying film that sets out to achieve certain goals and excels at all of them."" ]";5

As many critics have alluded to, the film brilliantly handles its cancer subject and balances the serious, the emotional, and the funny, phenomenally. Every transition is seamless and it honestly never felt as though the film was disjointed or did not know what it was. Rather, the film decided to take a lighter approach to cancer, which is appreciated. While it still hit you with the true emotion and the pain and suffering as necessary, it tried to lighten the mood throughout, which is why Seth Rogen is perfect here. As a comic, he really brought his A game here and served as a perfect foil to the subject as a whole. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic here, as are Anna Kendrick, Philip Baker Hall, and Anjelica Huston. Huston played the mother perfectly and really felt authentic as the mother of a cancer victim. The direction and the writing are the winners here as the film manages to tackle the dirty and gritty elements of cancer, while also being a really fun and entertaining comedy. 50/50 is a true joy to watch and will make you laugh and cry, as it did to me."" ]";5

The film has an elegance and beauty that is largely unmatched thanks to Michelle Williams' electric, engaging, and ravishing, portrayal of one of the most magnetizing figures in history. Eddie Redmayne and Kenneth Branagh are also very good here and both show how easy it was to be pulled in by her even when you resisted.

Tilda Swinton is brilliant, Ezra Miller is great, and John C. Reilly is great as the enabling father. The first film I have seen from director Lynne Ramsay, this one virtually guarantees I will be checking out her other work. Brilliant direction on her part to really capture the mental anguish the actions of one kid can cause and the long lasting damage that comes with it. However, the film does a great job leading up to it and really building to the event that really provides a good context for the actions taken by Kevin and shows how it could have been prevented if somebody had done something.

The characters act as if they are trying to cram their entire life into the time they have, which to me, makes complete sense. I have no idea how else people would respond. However, where the film is truly a resounding success is in the touching elements: romance and reconciliation. Sure, it is anything but original, but is deeply affecting all the same and really hits home.

A film about human beings who happen to be strippers (this does not define them in any sense), Magic Mike is a down to earth and engrossing character study. Channing Tatum, Alex Pettfyer, and Matthew McConaughey, are all phenomenal here and McConaughey especially nails his role. The direction from Steven Soderbergh is very good and the film does a good job making the story be more about than the stripping. Rather, it is about these characters, their struggles, and the things they must overcome. Magic Mike, however, is held back by a few things. First, there is some filler here. Some scenes really added nothing, namely the scene where Adam (Pettfyer) fondles the breasts of another male stripper's wife. While she does have a nice set, admittedly, the scene adds absolutely nothing to the film. Cody Horn is also entirely unconvincing here and her character's role in the film really does very little. She is entirely useless for this film. However, aside from that, Magic Mike is a pretty good film. Both entertaining and an entertaining character study, do not judge a book by its cover here."" ]";5

Blessed with a great concept and very interesting design for the future, Looper has some great direction and writing from Rian Johnson. Looper has some very good action sequences, but its real strengths are from its heady science fiction thrills and from the emotional impact it has on you. In addition, it also has some interesting things to say on the nature of evil in our world, as well as the importance of family and love. When it comes to the time travel feature of the film, it is not afraid to raise questions about what time travel really means. Do things keep repeating and we are powerless to stop them? Are we able to change our futures by altering our pasts? These questions are a few of many that come up, but for a major motion picture, Looper certainly is risky, not just in its willingness to test its audience, but in the fact that it was made at all. Thankfully, it paid off in spades and did quite well financially, but most importantly, it is a really great film. Fun, smart, and original, Looper is easily one of the best sci-fi films of the 2010s."" ]";5

It can be great and powerful, but it can also be incredibly meandering and overly confusing. For the most part, these elements are divided between the two halves of the film. The first half is slow, unfocused, and hard to grasp. The second half is powerful, down to earth, and a moving look at this girl in her crazy town. Though the townsfolk can be deeply annoying and overtly alcoholic, their encounters are still unique and crazy enough to be oddly endearing. Quvenzhané Wallis made me want to smack her at times for being so damn annoying, but at other times, she was a brilliant actress with incredible nuance. There is a happy medium somewhere, but luckily, her performance was still quite good, even if annoying at times. The film is an interesting blend of fantasy and drama, while being set in post-Katrina Louisiana that is still under constant threat of hurricanes. Sadly, the film's unwillingness to teach the audience about its setting and its characters beyond little exposition is really unfortunate and holds the film back."" ]";5

Now, it is entirely twisted, but the pitch black comedic moments lighten things up a bit. The sexual scenes are also a little much for my taste and at times this one was basically pornographic. However, Matthew McConaughey is so good in this one it hurts. Joe Cooper, his character, is easily one of the best villains I have seen in a long time, maybe the best I have seen since Hannibal Lecter. Twisted, sadistic, and entirely crazy, McConaughey's Cooper commands the screen and incites terror the first time you see him and even more so as you see just how insane and sadistic he truly is. Nobody is really safe from his wrath, not even the viewer, as by the end, it feels like he has even taken a piece of you. This one is violent and a tough watch, so it is not for everybody without question, but if this one does not leave you speechless at the end, I do not know what will.

In many films that focus on young people, the child actors are sometimes spotty with their acting, but here, both Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, though both just 12 at the time of filming, were remarkable. Their innocence shines through throughout. In addition to them, Bruce Willis and Edward Norton were fantastic, as were Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and Jason Schwartzman, in what is a really star-studded and talented cast.

Rarely do I watch a film and be left sitting there with chills and nothing but a stupid smile as I think of how this one film re-affirmed my love for film and showed me truly how powerful a medium it can be at times. Brilliantly acted by Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a marvelous look at those of us who are quiet and lonely. While I do not fully identify with Lerman's character, certainly a good portion of his life resembled mine and for that, it completely touched my heart and struck me to my core. However, even the parts I did not identify with did this. As a whole, it is truly just a powerful and moving film that is leaving me speechless right now. Brilliantly written, directed, and acted, the only problem I can truly think of for this one that keeps it from being a perfect film for me is that as honest a portrayal of life for wallflowers as it is, it can become a little...idealistic and, as such, unrealistic. Beyond that minor complaint though, this is an amazing coming age drama that should touch your heart and if it does not, I do not know what is wrong with you."" ]";5

1815;drive;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Forgive me father, for I have sinned. When I saw Drive for the first time in 2013, I had just finished my first film class in high school and was set to graduate from high school in a few weeks. Now, a week and a half removed from finishing college a semester early, it was time to atone for the sins of my youth. Unacquainted with good films at the time aside from the ones I saw in my class, I was ill-prepared for Drive. Finding it too violent and boring, I previously gave this film a 1/10. I know. The first of many rewatches from 2011 (Contagion, Source Code, The Ides of March, and The Artist are crying out for a re-evaluation), my second viewing of Drive was far more rewarding. Slow, elegant, and poetic, Drive is a remarkably brilliant film with great cinematography, a killer score, great dialogue, and great performances."", ""While I was wrong about this movie originally, I was right that it is incredibly violent. Not for the weak of heart (read: 2013 me), Drive is typical when it comes to Nicolas Winding Refn with its violence. With a violent hatred for people with eyes, Refn takes pleasure in having his films show people get stabbed in the eyes. Here, he also adds in a lot of stabs to the neck and a head being smashed like a watermelon dropped on a sidewalk. Thus, Drive is a hyperviolent film that turns violence into an art form. For example, the scene in the elevator where The Driver (Gosling) moves Irene (Carey Mulligan) out of the way and kisses her as the lights dim, is elegantly crafted and almost mystical in its movement. Juxtaposing the beauty of this movement with the swift violent kicks of The Driver into the would be assailant's face is both jarring and disturbingly gorgeous. Refn is into cheap violence. Instead, his is well shot and purposefully carried out with each swing of a blade or fist carrying significant purpose and elegance."", ""What certainly complements this gorgeous choreography of violent moments is the synth-filled score from Cliff Martinez and the stunning cinematography. Put together, this trio turns Drive from a violent neo-noir crime film into a dream-like whirlwind of gorgeous images and sounds. The film undeniably formalistic in this sense, often using the hyperreality of Los Angeles to escape the boundaries of reality and transcend into being both a dream and a piece of art. At all times, the viewer it is a film due to the techniques utilized by Refn that do not replicate reality. Instead, the techniques serve the purpose of shining beautiful neon lights over a cruel and wicked world. Accenting this is the dialogue of the film, which is minimalist at best. Poetic and purposeful, the dialogue flows brilliantly even if there are large gaps between deliveries. There is a certain lyricism to conversations here, such as those between The Driver and Irene. Though he speaks very little, The Driver is incredibly well developed. Do not mistake his silent nature for weakness as he is actually a menacing, smart, and calculated figure. His every move is precise and chosen carefully. The only time where he takes risks is with Irene. A well-written relationship, the chemistry between The Driver and Irene works, even if given very little screentime. In the time they are given - namely when they go to the river - the writing allows the duo to be a great couple. Stylistically, Refn highlights the almost holy nature of this relationship repeatedly throughout the film. Often when they are together, such as at the river and in the elevator, the film spills a light from above on them that gives them an almost golden glow. Mirroring the brightness they bring to each other's lives, which are otherwise shrouded in darkness, these are the brightest shots of the film and this is clearly purposeful."", ""As The Driver, Ryan Gosling is tremendous. Cool, laid back, and intense, Gosling brings his charms and charisma to the film in a subtle way. Though he is quiet and does not use his mouth, his presence exudes something his words could never capture. As Irene, Carey Mulligan is typically brilliant. Though she is not given much to work with - as this is largely Gosling's show - her brief moments on screen are careful and reserved. She is as withdrawn as The Driver, but equally brings a certain passion and innocence to her scenes. The supporting cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Oscar Isaac, Albert Brooks, and Ron Perlman, are equally great. As gangsters, Brooks and Perlman are cold, malicious, and brutal. However, they are still written with this odd sort of poetry and romanticism for the bruality they can deliver on those that do them wrong."", ""As with the rest of his neon trilogy, Nicolas Winding Refn gets great pleasure of watching beautiful people do horrific things. Here, Gosling is a mentally unhinged getaway driver whose looks and charisma juxtapose the violence he commits."" ]";5

However, in Sinister, it does a fantastic job crafting an eerie and fully unsettling atmosphere thanks to a great back story, mysterious happenings, and the phenomenal score (did I mention the score?). Sinister is successful because it does not rely on these scares, rather it is the atmosphere that keeps you on edge and thrills you throughout. Ethan Hawke and the rest of the cast do a good job, but really, this shows director Scott Derrickson truly does have talent. With this atmospheric and creepy horror film, any claims to the opposite can be disregarded. A truly haunting experience, Sinister works well not only as a horror film, but as a crime film with a truly captivating story behind it that you try and piece together along with Hawke. If this film does not scare you, I truly envy you, because I was petrified from the very beginning."" ]";5

A talented cast of actors appear in this mixed bag of great, good, bad, and awful that is Beautiful Creatures. Greenlit in the aftermath of the Twilight earthquake and directed by Richard LaGravanese, Beautiful Creatures has some elements that really win you over and make the viewer forget any possible connection to Twilight. Other moments remind you that this is a young adult film crafted to appeal to teenage girls who loved Twilight, while only intermittently providing enjoyment for the sacrificial lamb of a boyfriend. Yet, for film fans, Beautiful Creatures is not wholly unredeemable and, actually, by the end I had quite a good time with this one."", """", ""First, the negatives. Beautiful Creatures often resembles Gilligan's Island, in terms of its script with this cast of actors. Much like the actors in Gilligan's Island, the cast of Beautiful Creatures is left stranded on an island with nothing but some magic powers to try and claw their way back to shore. Somehow, they occasionally do, but this does not stop the writers from having Emma Thompson gleefully exclaim, \""Well slap my ass and call me Sally!\"" This line is actually said in the film by Emma Thompson's character, Sarafine Duchannes. That said, much of the bad writing comes courtesy of the film's attempts to appeal to its target demographic. Telling the story of a high school boy, Ethan Wate (Ehrenreich) who falls in love with Lena (Alice Englert), Beautiful Creatures is essentially the reversal of Twilight. Here, Lena is a \""caster\"", which is essentially a witch, but not called a witch. As a 15-year old, she is nearing the time when she will be claimed on her 16th birthday. Her mother, Sarafine, is a dark caster. She uses her powers for evil. Ridley (Rossum), her cousin, was also claimed for the dark side and is now a siren (some inspirational casting right there). Women are doomed to be claimed based on their own internal inclinations. Men, however, can switch. This is the case for Lena's uncle, Macon (Irons). Though a dark caster, he turns to the light side for Lena's sake to try and keep her light. This is all important because whether she goes dark or light will determine the fate of the universe. The more I write this, the more it feels like Star Wars dropped into the modern day with some Civil War flashbacks (women in the Duchannes bloodline are cursed to be dark because of some Duchannes woman in the Civil War who brought her mortal significant other back to life). As you can tell, this one gets a bit outlandish at times. Yet, it remains always watchable even when the film refuses to own its silliness."", """", ""As one review I read stated, the film needs a bit of \""Tim Burton's charm\"". This is certainly fair and while, given his present output, he probably would have dropped the ball, Beautiful Creatures as directed by Tim Burton would be a way better film. This outlandish plot leads to a lot of playing it straight. Yet, unintentional humor is afoot in this film and is indiscernible from actual jokes. The actual jokes do work quite often here, but the amount of unintentional humor really does hold this one back from transcending expectations even further. This is where Burton would have come in, as the film would have felt light and silly in spite of the serious consequences of the plot."", """", ""Romantically, the chemistry between Ehrenreich and Englert is actually very good. They can charm you socks off with the idealistic look at love and romance, which really captures the element that can make teenage romance films so watchable at times. It does not hurt they are solid actors, though the dialogue does do some damage to their acting skills in this one. Thematically, the film is incredibly tight. With romance films, the film's approach to love is what always captivates me the most. Here, Beautiful Creatures effectively shows the duality of love. Rather than spelling it out for you, the film uses visuals and character actions to showcase how love can single-handedly lead you out of the darkness, but love and the pain it can cause can throw you into the fire. The climactic sequence, even if it has some clunky dialogue, really does nail this theme very well and, more than anything else, this portion made me the most satisfied. In terms of religion, the film takes an interesting approach. The first hour seems very anti-Christian, but the second half clears this up entirely through Viola Davis' character, Amma. A keeper, or protector, of casters, Amma is a Christian. Through her the film showcases that, while casters may be written off as abominations of Satan by the overly Christian community, it only makes sense that if God created everything, he created them as well. This feels shockingly close to my argument for evolution and rectifying it with religion. For this, Beautiful Creatures is even better in my eyes."" ]";5
1818;man-of-steel;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Man of Steel, the first film in the new DC Cinematic Universe, is certainly a very flawed film, but for me, I think there is enough in the \""pro\"" category to outweigh those negatives. Firstly, I really liked the acting and the casting throughout. Some were unhappy with Amy Adams' Lois Lane, for both the way she was portrayed and for her not looking like Lois Lane, but as a person who is not a huge comic book guy, I did not really care. She's a great actress and it is able to show in this film to a degree. In addition to the acting, the special effects were spectacular and the cinematography was stupendous at times. There were some seriously gorgeous shots in this one and it is one of the few superhero movies where I really noticed that area. However, I will say that it does try to do a lot and struggles from typical origin story pitfalls. The pacing can be extremely bad at times and the dialogue is pretty horrendous at times and middling at best.  Overall, Man of Steel is a slightly above average film that succeeds in some areas and fails in others, but overall does a nice job setting up the new Superman story and the new universe."" ]";5
1819;stoker;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Within the first half hour, it becomes clear that Chan-wook Park had just finished watching Alfred Hitchcock's classic Shadow of a Doubt and decided, \""That is my next movie.\"" From naming a character Uncle Charlie and making him a very mysterious figure, Park's film plays like a remake of Shadow of a Doubt until he hits the halfway point and turns it into a movie Hitchcock never could due to the Hays Code. That said, I would not be surprised if this were the film Hitchcock wished he could have made. Perverse, sick, and decidedly twisted, Stoker landed far better for me than the only other work I have seen by Chan-wook Park, Oldboy, but still feels like a largely hollow experience."", ""Symbolic and emotionally withdrawn, Stoker stars Mia Wasikowska as India Stoker. A weird, dark, and emotionally disturbed teenager, India is grieving the loss of her father, Richard (Jacki Weaver). Her grieving process is interrupted by the arrival of the mysterious Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) who immediately starts coming onto both India and her mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman). Given the reaction of the teenage girls to seeing Uncle Charlie, it is hard to imagine that the pair did not want the attention given to them by Charlie. However, as people keep missing that would expose the mystery that lies behind Charlie's past (which he claims was all over-the-world due to business), things become all the more unsettling and creepy. Here, Park has a lot of fun with the symbolic elements at play here and really just likes disturbing his viewer."", ""Early on, we can tell that India is quite mentally ill. Evidently, so can Uncle Charlie who is shown to have taken a liking to India since she was very little. In his equally depraved mind, it is apparent that he knew the two of them were both disturbed, unlike India's father Richard. Now, Richard could certainly tell as well as he strove to keep them apart. Once together, however, it clear that they were meant for one another. Charlie, in many ways, is grooming India. Not sexually (okay, sexually), but deviously. Since he was a boy, Charlie killed. India did as well, but her father sought to keep it be restricted to birds. Unfortunately, with Charlie in the picture, she is introduced to the concept of killing people and, given a shower sequence, the thought really turns her on. Of all the disturbing sequences in the film, this one is certainly up there as one of the most chilling."", ""The chilling nature of their relationship is amplified by the great acting from Wasikowska and Goode. Neither are ever appreciated by the mainstream as they should be, in spite of both being terrific actors. Wasikowska plays the very restrained and inward-focused India with zero emotion, which is perfect for the character. Watching her as India and in other films such as Tracks or Crimson Peak is honestly night-and-day, given the emotion she displays in those films and the complete lack of feeling she demonstrates here. Goode, meanwhile, plays Uncle Charlie with more emotion, but still it feels as though something were missing. From the very beginning, he emanates this mysterious vibe of the character, as you can tell something is very off about this man and he may not be what he seems. While this is certainly the Shadow of a Doubt influence and for those who have seen the film, you undeniably know that Charlie is not all that he presents. But, even if you have not seen Hitchcock's film, Goode plays the role in such a way that this lack of clarity as to who he is and where he is actually from becomes incredibly clear."", ""On the other side, Kidman is most certainly depraved, but in a different way. She plays the role of Evelyn akin to how Wasikowska plays India, yet older. She is wiser, more mature, and as such, more restrained. She does not display emotion, other than to express her general disdain for her daughter. Evelyn is incredibly chilled and withdrawn into her own shell and Kidman brings this element to life with brute force in the film. The cinematography, of course, is also gorgeous. The main highlights being three sequences that truly stick out. The beginning with Wasikowska in the field, narrating the opening is breathtakingly shot with the sun behind her as she walks through this field. Secondly, when India is brushing Evelyn's hair. The camera seamlessly and breathtakingly flows from Kidman's bright red hair to the green of the leaves as India describes to Evelyn the feeling she gets from the hunt. Honestly, seen in conjunction with the end of the film, the scene is also quite revealing about India's character, as it demonstrates the impact hunting has on her and certainly foreshadows to her desire to change her game. The third shot that sticks out is the ending. With blood spraying on leaves and the gun trained to India's eye, Park truly captures the odd, perverse beauty of the moment with sickening skill."", ""All of this said, Stoker is still imperfect. In many respects, it may be too withdrawn."" ]";5

A fitting end to the \""Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy\"" with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, The World's End is just as funny, even if it does become a little over-the-top at times. Additionally, Rosamund Pike, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Eddie Marsan, are a worthy supporting cast that really work well together as a group of friends. Plus, the film is not just debauchery, as it supports its antics with very good looks at growing up, nostalgia, your hometown, addiction, and life in general.

The writing is pretty good, not great, but it works well throughout and the direction here is pretty good and the story winds up being told well. The acting is really good. I loved Nick Offerman here, he really played the role of the father really well and brought a certain aura to the role that worked really well. In addition, the characters throughout were really well-developed and their stories made sense. They felt like real human beings everyone knows, rather than just cardboard cutouts of teenagers. However, my main problem here deals with some highly improbable things happening in the plot. I do not want to spoil at all, so I won't say it outright, but for coming of age films, they need to be grounded a bit in reality and not overly outlandish. In this case, this one seems highly unlikely at times, which is odd since the characters and problems are so real and well done. Yet, the plot itself just throws it off a bit at times and really needed to be more realistic."" ]";5

Those special effects when Pi is in the middle of the ocean are absolutely stunning and really steal the show. The plot is imaginative, emotional, and a powerful look at human survival. That said, Life of Pi is not without its problems. The beginning, with Pi's backstory and how they get into the story, is not great. None of it is wrapped up by the end anyways and it ultimately just feels like filler because Ang Lee could not figure out another way to jump into the story. If it started with brief backstory on the boy, his family, his girl, and the zoo, then it would be better. Instead, we get the entire etymology of his name. Additionally, towards the middle, the ocean parts do drag a bit in spots. At a certain point, you want him to get saved just so we can get on with proceedings. That said, Life of P is a pretty impressive film, particularly visually. I can only imagine seeing this one in 3D, it had to have been a spectacular viewing experience."" ]";5

It is hard to think of an actor more on top of his game than Matthew McConaughey and Mud is no exception. His charisma and easy going demeanor really pull you in and, while he is not directly the protagonist (even though he plays the title character), you find yourself rooting for him and hoping things work out for him. On top of McConaughey, both Tye Sheridan and Jack Lofland did fantastic jobs. For actors of their age, they packed considerable emotion and passion into their roles and really impressed me. Also, the supporting cast, headed by Sam Shepard was also phenomenal and really helped. While Fargo is a superior film, a lot of Mud reminded me of Fargo. While it was a totally different film, the way the film totally embodies the region it depicts and sort of oozes with Southern charm is very similar to the way Fargo really represents Minnesota. Both are also beautifully filmed. Fargo's imagery really helped to define it, especially with the blue/white colorization, while Mud's visuals have the same effect, but with golden light on it as if it was shot in \""the magic hour\"" a la Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven."" ]";5

Sporting a well-written script packed with drama, laughs, mild romance, charm, and just enough adolescent angst, The Way Way Back is a very well done coming of age drama. Liam Jones is great in the lead role, though often outshined by Sam Rockwell, who is absolutely impeccable here in a role that exudes charisma and charm and was truly meant for him, without question. Toni Collette, Steve Carell, and AnnaSophia Robb are also all very good in this one, though really the whole cast brings their A game. The film is well directed and well told for the most part and really has very few faults. While the romantic elements can seem cheesy and it does break no new ground, that is is not really a negative to me, as it does strike a chord at moments and makes you laugh at others.

The direction from Richard Linklater is yet again spectacular and the acting from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are once more perfection. Whereas the first two films, I believe, were largely optimistic, this one does paint quite a sad portrait of love as you age. Yet, in many respects, I think it is still a beautiful picture. It is a film that shows difficulties in relationships and leaves nothing out. However, the way in which it walks it back and shows the tender moments in the aftermath of war, it illustrates that though it can be messy and hurt, love is worth fighting for and the blood, sweat, and tears, spent in the pursuit of it are not in vein. For this, Before Midnight is the best of the trilogy, though they are hard to separate, since all three are such great films.

That being said, there are not many films as beautiful as this one and as artistic as this one. Sporting such Russian concepts as the \""Kuleshov effect\"" and montage, Only God Forgives is a highly artistic exercise in the hands of the ever talented Refn. The acting is pretty non-descript, namely thanks to the lack of dialogue for the most part. That being said, what acting there is, is solid. It is wooden, but that is purposeful, so the actors did a good job capturing that. The cinematography and lighting are both truly breathtaking and what stand as the main reason I largely did enjoy this one. Though it is not for everyone, Only God Forgives is a beautifully crafted film that may seem aimless and meaningless to some, but if you are willing to indulge it, you should enjoy it, but only if you do not mind such brutal violence."" ]";5

Not only is it gorgeously shot and brilliantly put together, but it features great performances from Casey Affleck, Rooney Mara, and Ben Foster. Very similar to Terrence Malick's films Badlands and Days of Heaven, both stylistically and story-wise, Ain't Them Bodies Saints is nowhere near as good as either of those in terms of pure film quality, but in terms of entertainment, it blows them out of the water. Far more entertaining, though still quite slow and tedious along the way, the film succeeds largely on its mise en scene and acting. The story is a bit weak, though it was told well, but it is never quite compelling as it could be and for an hour and a half, it does plod along a good bit. Not as weak or slow as a Malick film, but still. All the same, this one is a film that shows the potential of its director and showcases the talents of its brilliant cast."" ]";5

Really cool look to this one to go with the great feel. Finally, and most importantly, it is legitimately scary. From beginning to end, it makes you feel a sense of dread and provides enough scares to cause you to jump six feet in the air far too many times. The Conjuring stands tall as one of the best recent horror films and, undoubtedly, one of the scariest films ever made, in large part thanks to it relying on the same types of scares to the table that its predecessors do.

The battle sequences, the weapons, the ships, the everything, all brilliantly thought out and planned. The acting, particularly from Tom Cruise, is also great. The plot itself is a bit hit-and-miss, but as a whole, it is interesting and entertaining enough. However, the plot can get caught up in itself frequently and I felt like it was trying to be deep at times, but kind of missed the mark there. In addition, there are certainly some plotholes as they blend many different science fiction films (Moon being a recent example of one they borrowed from) to make one mishmash of a film. However, luckily, the acting and imagery are great enough to make me ignore those concerns and allow me to lose myself in the film.

The characters here are anything but one-dimensional and the film does a great job diving into their lives in a 90 minute run time. The only complaint here is that the film can be a little slight and, at times, the quirky humor can fail and things just turn awkward.

It is so adorable, moving, and emotional, I would truly have to be soulless not to be swept up in its beautiful portrayal of life and its perfect imperfections. This film is truly a delight in every definition of the word. Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams have incredible chemistry and are so adorable it truly caused me physical pain. The film made me laugh, cry, and smile, all at the same time for its depictions of love and of loss, especially given the situation of the film. It may be super sentimental and is certainly guilty of squeezing every last tear out of you purposely, but dammit if I would not love to cry while watching this one again.

In many ways, that is what makes this film so successful. It is confusing as all get out, then it shows a little \""hint\"" and then as that sinks in, you realize that that may not be the answer we were looking for.

Standing amongst his best work undoubtedly, Blue Jasmine really hit home at times and was an incredibly moving film. Cate Blanchett was absolutely stunning here, as were Sally Hawkins and Bobby Cannavale. All of them really outdid themselves and turned in phenomenal performances. As with all Allen films, it is more-or-less a slice of life kind of film, so it will only appeal to you if that is up your alley. Fortunately, for me, it is. I am fine with not being told everything and not getting all the answers in return for fantastic characters. Blue Jasmine delivers that in spades with real human beings left-and-right who are multi-dimensional and, as a result, their problems become endlessly relatable and touching. Blue Jasmine is a film that could very reasonably cause the tears to flow. Overall, this character-driven comedy-drama is a force to be reckoned with."" ]";5
1836;nebraska;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Nebraska is that type of one of a kind film that only comes along every once in a while and when you see it, you feel entirely moved and happy that you finally saw it. The acting is great, led by great performances by Bruce Dern, June Squibb, Will Forte, and Bob Odenkirk, though really, everyone turns in a good performance here and really embody their character. This was the first film by Alexander Payne I had ever seen and I regret taking this long to start work on his filmography. The cinematography here is gorgeous and serves as the perfect backdrop to this one, as the camera really finds every inch of beauty in this rural setting and maximizes on it. The black-and-white is also a major plus for me, as it just seems to fit. Overall, this one is a story about a man's relationship with his aging father, who certainly seems to have lost a step over the years, but even then, they were never very close. However, when his father hinks he won a million dollars, they start getting closer and he learns more and more about his dad, bringing them closer together. Ultimately, this study of their relationship is entirely endearing to viewers of all ages and if it does not touch your heart, you better head to the doctor to see if you even have one. As a whole, Nebraska is a very good film with great acting, writing, and a brilliantly moving story."" ]";5
1837;rush;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""This one was pretty good as a whole. Daniel Bruhl absolutely killed his role here and really stood out for me in this one. The race sequences are expertly put together to make them very intense and thrilling, plus the sound mixing for the cars and the racing was great.  In addition, I felt like the 1976 season was covered very well, even as a non-Formula 1 fan. I may be ignorant to things they may have missed, but what they showed was very satisfying and felt like it covered a good bit of information. However, I cannot say the same for the stuff before they get into 1976. The foundations of the rivalry and both drivers' personal lives before 1976 were shown, but poorly put together at best as things seemed to be \""rush\""ed through and it ultimately left me feeling very unsatisfied. For the first bit of the film, things seemed to happen with no background to them and it almost felt like the film was just skipping from one unrelated scene to another. Luckily, this problem goes away once they get into 1976, but before that, it is a bit messy. For that, it hampered my overall enjoyment a bit, but as a whole, the film is pretty good and very good entertainment."" ]";5
1838;lone-ranger;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Championed by director Quentin Tarantino and noted film critic Matt Zoller Seitz as a prime candidate for re-evaluation, I must say that I agree. With an knack for being over-the-top, The Lone Ranger may drag in spots, but is a tremendous time with audacious action set pieces at every turn. The soon-to-be-famed train sequence at the end and the opening sequence on a different train are phenomenal. While the middle could be a bit better and the film does go on for far too long, The Lone Ranger is a fun film that feels like a throwback to the bombastic days of 1970s and 1980s blockbusters. Channeling childish energy and a sense of childlike wonder for the mystery of the film's hero, director Gore Verbinski creates a blockbuster movie that is out of place in year 2013."", ""Since the days of Steven Spielberg revolutionizing the blockbuster movie in the 1970s and 1980s with fun adventure films that more than satisfied adults and became nostalgia for kids of then and now, the blockbuster movie has changed. Now, the films are shot like television shows, have quips at every turn that distract from the action, and are easily digestable. They lack intrigue, a sense of adventure, and feel manufactured. Now, of course, a lot of this comes from the resurgence of the studio's power in the filmmaking and the death of the big budget auteur. Yet, director Gore Verbinski has shown an ability to operate with a big budget and still come out on top with his 2003 film Pirates of the Caribbean. Though its sequels have slacked and been overly manufactured, the original is a fun, bombastic, action-packed, and guilt-free excursion across the oceans with Jack Sparrow. Taking that same energy and sense of adventure and applying it to The Lone Ranger, Verbinski's film was met with incredible levels of ridicule in the United States. As mentioned, some of his peers and noted critics such as Seitz or those in Britain found great value in the film. This is no mistake as the film seems to have escaped those entrusted to critique it. Accustomed to the new age blockbusters, critics could not stomach this throwback to old school blockbusters. While recognizing its action set pieces, its flaws and plotholes became the focus and, as such, were easily derided. The sooner folks realize that every film is flawed and has plot holes, the happier we will all become and all those plot holes do is distract from the fun that the film conjures up. There is no going through the motions or checking off boxes here. Rather, Verbinski sets up John Reid (Armie Hammer) and Tonto (Johnny Depp) to have an audacious adventure in order to stop Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson), while saving Rebecca (Ruth Wilson). An old school premise and execution, The Lone Ranger is pure energy."", ""This energy really is infectious to watch. As said, the middle part of the film takes a bit too long to get through. This likely where the film loses people as the plotting is a bit much at times and can seem a bit convenient. Of course, the film never loses its sense of fun with Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp having incredible chemistry with one another. Occasionally making light of their situations, the jokes always land, as does the Native American mysticism delivered by Tonto. Really setting the scene and marking the film as one about avenging the death of the Comanche tribe that Tonto was apart of, The Lone Ranger is essentially a lesson in the horrors committed against the Natives in the name of \""progress\"". However, adding in mythology regarding the Natives that Tonto has made up as a coping mechanism, the film often becomes quite sad when you learn how Tonto wound up where he did. Yet, he is not as crazy as he seems as many of his \""made up elements to explain the world\"" actually do explain things and allow the film as a whole to make a lot more sense. Though hardly realistic and decidedly over-the-top, the film is told as a story from Tonto to a young boy in 1933. As such, elements are likely exaggerated and exist solely to extend the legend of The Lone Ranger. Plus, the banter that it creates between Tonto and the Lone Ranger is always rich and rewarding with some great humor to it, as a result of their chemistry together and comic delivery."", ""The film also adds in some solid supporting characters in the form of characters such as Red (Helena Bonham Carter). Though underutilized, Red is a madame in a brothel with an ivory leg that she hides a gun in. A little bit crazy and unafraid to use her leg as a weapon, Red has some great comedy to her, largely thanks to Carter's performance. As the villains, Tom Wilkinson and William Fichtner are terrific. Wilkinson, portraying a cruel businessman after wealth, is calculating, smart, and unfeeling. As the brother of the businessman, Fichtner plays an outlaw wanted by the law. Brutal, cannibalistic, and truly evil, Fichtner plays a terrifically menacing bad guy that instills great fear in our hearts."" ]";5

First off, like all Wes Anderson films, it has a very distinctive look, which is endlessly gorgeous, but I think this one is the most beautiful of his works for me. Every set piece, every costume, every shot, every everything, was absolutely breathtaking. I would be hard-pressed to find a shot that is not beautiful. The amount of symmetry in practically every shot was also very impressive and shows you how much work was put into this one. One thing that differentiaties this one from other works of his that I have seen is how the exterior shots of buildings (such as the hotel) look almost animated from a distance even though they are obviously not. It was a very odd, yet awesome touch. On top of the beauty of the film, it is absolutely hilarious. Ralph Fiennes makes for a hilarious main character (not really the lead) and there were so many scenes with him that were absolutely hilarious. I honestly never expected to laugh as much as I did, but this was easily the funniest Anderson film I have seen yet. On top of these positives, the story was incredibly engrossing and never really caused me to lose any interest, as there was no real lull in the film. Overall, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a great film that is probably my favorite Anderson film to date and will likely wind up being one of my favorites of 2014."" ]";5

1842;prometheus;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Heading into this one, I heard a ton of differing opinions, but at the end of the day, I came away from this one with a positive take. The cinematography and special effects are undoubtedly the star of this film and are breathtaking to look at, each shot is achingly beautiful, and the tech gadgets are very cool and the other effects very well done. In addition, Ridley Scott's direction is good, as expected. The acting from Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, and Idris Elba, is very good, especially Fassbender. I did not love Noomi Rapace here and was left wondering how they could not have found somebody better for the role. The main complaint I had heard about this one beforehand was the script, but I personally have no complaints and thought it was just fine. Unoriginal, sure, and heavily inspired by the sci-fi films before it without question, but I did not come here expecting an original sci-fi project, now did I. At the end of the day, I came for thrills and great special effects and that is exactly what I got with a little bonus of great cinematography and acting. Only complaint would be the added religious (or non-religious?) element. I think the story could have been approached differently without inserting religion at every turn. Prometheus is far from a great film, but I will be damned if it is not an entertaining and satisfying prequel to Alien."" ]";5
1843;elysium;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""This one is a little slow at the beginning and a tad overwhelming as we get adjusted to this futuristic world, but once everything kicks in, it is a really great thrill ride with great action sequences. In addition, the last twenty minutes or so are great and really make up for most of the missteps the film takes earlier on. The direction here from Neill Blomkamp is very strong and the acting from Matt Damon is solid as well. However, Sharlto Copley really dominates the screen here and did a phenomenal job in his supporting role. Now, there are certainly some things I have problems with how certain things happen and why certain characters would do something (nearly out of the blue some of their actions), but it is ultimately made up by the beautiful set design, the really cool weapons they trot out, the good action, and the great ending. Without those things going for it, this one would have really sufferred from it, but thankfully, the end result is a good one and the film as a whole is quite enjoyable. This one delivered everything I could have expected out of a film of this type."" ]";5

Richard Ayoade also cemented his status as a director to keep an eye on in this one as this hauntingly beautiful, moving, unique, and entirely weird, films shows that he has all of the elements to become one of the top directors working down the line. There is a lot going on here and the relationship between the Eisenbergs and Mia Wasikowska's character is certainly important, but this one is truly over my head. I could probably take a stab at what this one is about (loneliness, self-worth, split personality, desire to be something you are not, etc.), but I doubt it truly encompasses everything here. The dystopian elements here were also a real cool touch, but this one truly excels in its brilliant blending and twisting of the dark comedy, drama, and thriller genres. Overall, The Double is a resounding success and if you like mind benders, this one is for you."" ]";5
1845;night-moves;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Night Moves is a the very definition of a slow burn thriller. It is not in a hurry to do anything and this both works to its benefit and to its detriment. Allowing it time to really milk tension, paranoia, and this sense of anticipation before the deed is done, Night Moves can often be quite tense. Yet, as a character-driven film, its slow pace only serves to highlight how poorly drawn out its characters are with the film relying on these hollow shells to really carry the film. Unfortunately, they are poorly equipped to perform the job and, as a result, the film often struggles. However, as a look at extremism, the war against pollution, and of the need to try and do something to help, Night Moves is a film about three wholly misguided individuals who opt to blow up a hydroelectric dam to make a statement. What that statement is, who knows. What is clear, however, is that this trio is poorly equipped to handle the ramifications of their actions."", ""The first half of this film is undoubtedly the stronger half with it depicting the lead up to the bombing of the dam. Pairing together Josh (Jesse Eisenberg), Dena (Dakota Fanning), and Harmon (Peter Sarsgaard), as three extreme environmentalists who plot to blow up a dam, the film's first half shows them getting ready. From buying a boat, fertilizer, and planning an exit strategy, Night Moves is filled with anticipation that is quickly converts to tension once they arrive at the river and at the dam. Refusing to use artificial tension via a score in these moments, director Kelly Reichardt largely relies upon situational tension. We know what they are doing, but nobody else does. As such, innocent small talk with a stranger and a parked car that could see their boat heading towards the dam are seemingly innocuous moments, but Reichardt drags these sequences out. They seem to take an eternity on their own, building anticipation and tension as we wait to see if the person will leave or will become suspicious about the intentions of the main characters. This is where the film's limited character development does not hurt it and its slow pace really helps a ton. By having the camera linger for a prolonged period of time, Reichardt makes us intensely uncomfortable and on the edge of our seats, as we wait to see if anything will happen at all."", ""It is in the second half where the film begins to struggle. With Harmon disappearing all together with the film opting to focus on how Josh and Dena cope with what they have done, the film just lacks the characters to make it work. Mostly predictable and forgettable in this second half, the film becomes quite dull. It feels too cold and distant with Eisenberg opting for a reserved and mute performance as Josh, refusing to ever show any emotion. This shtick works for his counter-part, Peter Sarsgaard, in many roles but it is an odd charismatic indifference that Sarsgaard presents. Eisenberg is just reserved and is a tough nut to crack. Worse yet, the writing makes no effort to develop his character in any meaningful way beyond him being an outdoorsy kind of guy who likes to grow vegetables and be a typical Oregon hipster. That is about all there is to him. Though he handles the events quite poorly, his response to Dena speaking up a bit is obvious and never really raises any eyebrows. In many ways, he just goes through the motions and tries to pretend as though nothing happened to the dam. Unfortunately, Reichardt takes this characterization to heart and just goes through the motions until the film ends. Contrary to the tense and unpredictable occurrences of the first half where the film litters unpredictable elements around its premise of blowing up the dam, the second half just floats on by and never tries to doll up its predictable climax. It allows the scene to come and go with Reichardt building it up as a huge moment with her camera lingering on Josh the whole time. Yet, we feel nothing. Anybody who has seen a film before knew this was coming and, unfortunately, Night Moves play it up to be some shocking event. Somehow, the dam being blown up - which is mentioned in the IMDB description of the film - is more shocking than how Josh responds to Dena's chatty nature."", ""After a tense, subtle, and smart first half, Night Moves descends into a pale and drab second half that may add to its themes, but is just too predictable and dull to actually work. Compared to the excellent first half, the second half bears little resemblance and feels like Reichardt quickly running out of road and trying to desperately find more to save the film from falling off a cliff. Unfortunately, when you have nowhere else to go, you have nowhere else to go."" ]";5

While the story is a familiar one, it is expertly told and very well written. The acting is solid and works well in the film. The direction from James Cameron is inspired and matches the expansive and daring chances taken in the visual storytelling of the film. However, the true stars are the visual effects team who do a truly phenomenal job to bring this story to life. With breathtaking visual effects and fantastic cinematography, Avatar comes to life through the visuals and breathes new life into a familiar, yet incredibly engaging, storyline. Due to this visual plethora of eye candy, Avatar reaches new levels never seen before in film that really elevates the film as an overall piece. While many leave Avatar feeling underwhelmed due to the now familiar use of CGI, 3D, and the bland story, I was left awestruck. While the visuals have led to a new trend in film, of which Avatar was the first, its effects hold up and, honestly, may still be the best use of its effects to date. A wonderous achievement, Avatar is a truly phenomenal work."" ]";5

Showing full knowledge of the genres he is playing with, Johnstone has a knack for crafting a truly chilling atmosphere and reinvigorating genre cliches. While Housebound is clearly heavily influenced by horror-comedy entries of yester year, the film introduces enough original ideas to get by on its own.

Philip Seymour Hoffman is stellar and it almost brings a tear to your eye realizing that this is his final role. Robin Wright, Rachel McAdams, and Willem Dafoe, are also all really good here, in addition to the supporting cast. It is a true actor's showcase here. The story is admittedly slow, but never ceases to be entirely engrossing and truly had me from the very beginning. It was a twisty and turny ride, especially the ending, which is fantastic and unexpected. \""A Most Wanted Man\"" is a departure from the usual spy thrillers of today that seem to always involve excessive action sequences. Here, it is dialogue driven and on the back of a great script, direction, and acting, is a resounding success.

Calvary brilliantly bends genres between dark comedy, mystery, and drama, throughout with many moments causing you to laugh, think, and cry. The film is brilliantly directed and written by John Michael McDonagh and the cinematography is also worthy of mention as it is gorgeous, helped in large part thanks to the absolutely breathtaking scenery in the area where it was shot. Truly gorgeous stuff and the camera took advantage of all of it. A film that is essentially about the Catholic Church and the role that it and God play in the lives of different people, Calvary succeeds on the back of that great acting I mentioned, as well as how powerful it truly is.

1851;if-i-stay;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Many will hate If I Stay because it is, well, very much a chick flick at times. But, even as a guy, I managed to enjoy this one on varying levels. At times, the romance was very, very cheesy. It was over the top and felt very unrealistic. On top of that, this one can be incredibly melodramatic. However, in saying that, there are many redeeming qualities for If I Stay that I truly feel outweigh the negative. For one, Chloe Grace Moretz is great. She oddly cannot seem to cry, sure, but she was very good. On top of that, this one got me to cry just a little bit at times, which was not what I expected at all. While a lot of it felt very authentic romance wise, emotionally, this one was on point and certainly did a great job there and managed to wind up being a very touching film. The script is also fine, not great, but it got the job done and the cinematography worked well for the most part with some good and some bad. The music is also very good on this one and really completed the film nicely. However, the real reason why I like this one is  because of the supernatural element here regarding death. Death fascinates me and this one had a very interesting twist on the whole idea of death, which certainly piqued my interest in that regard.

Michael Fassbender is absolutely stellar in the lead role, even if we do not really ever get to see his face. Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Scott McNairy, are also all very strong here.

In terms of the political commentary, Captain America's sequel soars above most other superhero movies. It uses its position as a popular movie to try and bring up things  that it feels could occur in our world if we continue down the path we are going down. However, it then returns to stereotypical superhero nonsense and, generally, feels like a run-of-the-mill summer superhero movie. Sure, it is one, and is a good one at that, but that does not mean it could not step up in \""class\"" a bit. On top of that, I felt the story was too much. The whole world is being threatened and all that it is being defended by is Captain America, The Black Widow, and Anthony Mackie? Really? Did Iron Man, Hulk, and Thor, call in sick that day or...?

I would also be remiss if I did not mention the brilliant score here. There is no wonder it got nominated for an Oscar, because it worked perfectly here. The acting, led by Joaquin Phoenix in a typically awesome performance and Scarlett Johansson in a great voice-only role, is great. Rooney Mara and Chris Pratt also stood out in particular here.

1855;magic-in-the-moonlight;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""For an atheist such as himself, this ultimately means a critique of religion or spiritual elements that he rejects as fake scams. Yet, here, Allen shows a hint of regret for his full on rejection of faith and religion. Certainly, Magic in the Moonlight does not endorse religion or show an about face turn from the director's hard line stance on the subject, but it does show a tinge of regret. While his aforementioned 2010 picture, which could be seen as a companion piece to this one, explored the joy of delusion, this film shows the joy of not being so pessimistic and antagonistic. Instead, enjoying the simple magic of daily life and the mysteries of the world that science cannot answer, one can find unbridled joy."", ""Starring Colin Firth and Emma Stone, the romance of the film may go awry a bit since Firth is twice Stone's age, but as with all of Allen's films, philosophy plays a huge part. Name dropping Freud and Nietzsche as often as he name drops God, Allen toys with the idea of his surrogate, magician and skeptic Stanley Crawford (Firth), coming to religion upon meeting Sophie Baker (Stone). A famed magician and debunker of mediums, Stanley is tasked with debunking Sophie as a medium capable of communicating with spirits. However, whatever her trick, Stanley begins to believe she actually is a medium and, as such, the very core of his beliefs is shaken beyond repair. When his aunt has an accident is in the hospital, he even begins to pray. But, he catches himself and begins to chastise himself for actually believing in Sophie and, as such, a spiritual side to the world. However, he is so pessimistic and self-righteous, he is unable to look beyond the scope of his own opinion. He merely looks at religion and the belief in mediums as nothing but delusions that distract people from their pain, rather than being actual solutions."", ""This pessimism hurts him in his romance with Sophie. He is such a pragmatist, he is unable to give into chance and take a risk with a girl who may be worth taking a risk for. Instead, he has a set idea as to what the woman he is with is supposed to do and be like. The feelings Sophie conjures within him are foreign and beyond rational thought, as such, they are wrong. Since they are inexplicable, it is beyond comprehension that is anything but his heart steering his head, which is disastrous. Thus, she must be rejected unless she agrees. It is only once he begins to look past this hard headedness that he begins to believe in her and, even when this faith is shaken, he is able to give into the magical mysteriousness of the world and follow his heart."", ""To me, this seems to be an admission of regret by Allen. Just as You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger saw him conceding that those that give into \""delusions\"" are happier than he will ever be, Magic in the Moonlight finds him admitting he should be less pessimistic. While he can still be an atheist, being outspoken on the subject and some focused on rationality may not be the best course of action, given the unbridled joy that giving into magic can create."", ""All of that said though, the chemistry between Firth and Stone could have been better. The casting of them as the leads is curious and hurts the final product, as does the predictability of the whole thing. That said, both turn in solid performances, even if neither is excellent in the film. The real joy is yet another late-period Woody Allen flick that finds him dumping characters into the European countryside and letting them drive around. That said, it does deviate a bit from his other works as it is far less neurotic than many of his films. Though Firth spews a lot of Allen-esque lines in regards to philosophy, he lacks the chaotic and colliding way of speaking that Allen has and many Allen surrogates have had, driving at the character's neurotic state of being. In Magic in the Moonlight, neurosis is not nearly as much of a factor, especially in comparison to the melancholy tinge of regret that dominates this picture. Mildly funny and somewhat romantic, the film largely succeeds philosophically and with the easy and light nature of entertainment that Woody Allen films always provide."" ]";5

It is a touch slow, but I never thought its pacing was particularly bad or anything, plus the reward, to me, was ultimately worth it. Though, even if the ending was not as good as it was, it still would have been worth it due to the stellar cinematography in this one, as well as the great acting from Viggo Mortensen, Kirsten Dunst, and Oscar Isaac. In regard to the former, it really is a very sleek and sexy film to look at, true eye candy. I just loved the look and feel of this one and it was beautifully crafted. The writing was alright, nothing to write home about, but it certainly got the job done. At times, it certainly feels like a watered down film from Alfred Hitchcock and if this one had a bit more about it, it would have been better, but as it stands, I did enjoy it and thought it was a solid little film."" ]";5
1858;starred-up;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Starred Up is a truly refreshing breath of fresh air into the prison subgenre. Often, these films can feel quite repetitive. Yet, here, it is a truly unique offering that may touch on similar notes as past prison films, but has a lot of worthy topics to bring to the table. Jack O'Connell is honestly mesmerizing here as he commands the screen and struggles with the world around him due to his damaged past. O'Connell's brilliance and passion are matched perfectly by Ben Mendelsohn in a truly aggressive, yet truly gentle father role. Rupert Friend and the rest of the cast also do quite well here in this film from director David Mackenzie. Thanks to the good writing and solid direction from Mackenzie, O'Connell's performance is allowed to take center stage and really tell the story at times. This film is packed to the absolute brim with emotion from its actors and its stories and it truly makes good on all of the emotional drama it presents. Overall, Starred Up is a fantastic character study that really makes you feel as though you are in prison with the characters."" ]";5
1859;kill-the-messenger;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Kill the Messenger is a passionate and truly tragic tale of how the media and the CIA murdered a man who exposed them for their egregious sins. A truly engaging and entertaining biopic, Kill the Messenger has a solid blend of drama and thrills through its story, even if it is a conventional biopic. Jeremy Renner turns in a very good performance here. Director Michael Cuesta does a good job balancing the facts and the entertainment and the end result is a largely tight film with just a few scenes that are more of the filler variety. Additionally, it is a really passionate film that will really make you mad if you let it. I watched it a day ago as of writing this and I am still fuming at the injustice of it all. Overall, Kill the Messenger is a solid film that follows the biopic narrative arc, but is a really good example of how to make real life compelling."" ]";5
1860;force-majeure;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Force Majeure is a very thorough look at marriage and patriarchal hierarchy. In particular, it provides an interesting look at masculinity and what it means to be a man after a family experiences a close brush with an avalanche. This look at marriage and family (especially the effect on the kids) is truly traumatic in many aspects. It really helps you to identify with these characters and when they are emotionally tormented, you are right there with them holding back tears. This film may not be comedic as it as been described by some, but it is a great example of drama in everyday life and, at times, pure thrills. Honestly, this film could be quite thrilling at times when you could cut the tension with the knife. Of course, these are always followed up with truly awkward encounters between these deeply broken characters. The direction by Ruben Ostlund was phenomenal, while the writing and acting were also very, very good. Overall, Force Majeure is really a winner that provides serious food for thought on the expectations placed upon men by women and by society."" ]";5

The dialogue and direction are very good, but it just felt like the narrative elements of this film were lacking. The story is not overly complex, but it just feels like it had no need to be this long, as they keep running into characters from the Lord of the Rings that feel as though they are there solely for nostalgia purposes. I have never read The Hobbit, so I have no idea what is added, but there are just so many tiebacks to the original trilogy that this one feels as though it is trying to ride on the coattails of that series rather than on its own strengths, which bothered me. That said, Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving, Richard Armitage, and Cate Blanchett, are all very good here and this is a film that does a great job setting up its succeeding sequels. Cannot wait to check those out."" ]";5

Melissa McCarthy and Naomi Watts are also both pretty good here. There is not a ton to say on this, because as I said, it does break much new ground when it comes to sentimental dramedies, other than to say that this one is quite well made and extremely entertaining. While not original, it does not stop it from being a good film featuring a great performance from Murray."" ]";5

However, I am very glad I came around, because this was bar none by favorite Marvel movie yet. It is funny, thrilling, well acted, well written, well directed, moving, touching, and endlessly entertaining. All of the characters are very well developed and lovable in their own ways, though my personal favorites were Groot and Rocket. The special effects are very well done and I am certainly glad I saw it in 3D, as it is very much well worth the higher price. I cannot recommend this one enough and if this one does not touch you and leave you with a smile on your face at the end, you are simply not human. There is a lot of hype surrounding this one and, for me, it more than lived up to that hype. In Marvel we trust?"" ]";5
1864;nightcrawler;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and very well written, Nightcrawler is a great debut for director Dan Gilroy, another feather in the cap for cinematographer Robert Elswitt, and yet another example of why Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the top actors working today. Creepy and unhinged, Gyllenhaal's performance in the lead was great, as you truly believe every word he says and all of his mannerisms and oddities. However, to me, one of the films best features was the cinematography, in particular the lighting. In line with other great films that capture Los Angeles at night such as Drive and Collateral, Nightcrawler is beautifully shot and lit. Another major plus for this one would have to be the way it operates as a biting criticism of the television news industry. Showing them as morally questionable and willing to do anything for ratings, this one certainly shows the shady side of television and raises many questions that should be answered, such as the morality of showing some of the footage shown. Overall, Nightcrawler is a thrilling, intense, and very creepy, experience that should help propel both Gilroy and Gyllenhaal to further success."" ]";5
1865;wild;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""This one will not appeal to everyone since it is a character study of a deeply flawed woman, but I really enjoyed it. Not only is it beautifully filmed, but Reese Witherspoon turns in a fantastic and emotionally vulnerable performance that really serves as a great example of her talents. Director Jean-Marc Vallee sure knows how to get a good performance out of his actors and it is not just limited to Witherspoon, but to the whole cast as well. Wild is a tale of self-discovery and making amends for your past demons. What it truly does well it is feels authentic, it feels like an open book that is desiring for human connection, and it is not afraid to get dark or to get light (it is quite funny at times). Wherever the story went, it felt real and, honestly, was deeply affecting. This journey rides on Witherspoon's performance and with her turning in such a heartfelt and down-to-earth performance, there is no way the movie could be bad."" ]";5
1866;john-wick;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A sleek and stylish action thriller, John Wick is very much an action movie, but its action is so well done, it never becomes numbing and boring. From brilliantly choreographed fight scene to brilliantly choreographed fight scene, this one is a labor of love from directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch and it shows. Their direction is assured, especially for a debut. A beautifully shot and crafted action thriller, this film shows it is not just a dog. It is what the dog represents, especially for Mr. Wick. The backstory is great, as is the world created by the film. I cannot wait for the sequel now, just to see more of this world of crime and its various characters. Keanu Reeves is great, as is Michael Nyqvist. John Leguizamo and Ian McShane have small roles here, but I enjoyed their performances all the same. Additionally, Willem Defoe is very good. Overall, John Wick is a menacing little action thriller that hits all the right notes and is thoroughly captivating."" ]";5
1867;the-voices;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The Voices serves as a great platform to Ryan Reynolds to show off his skill and he really takes that opportunity and runs with it. He is phenomenal in a truly unhinged and chilling performance. He plays the mentally ill psycho very well and almost convinces you it's not an act. The film is kind of funny, but operates better when it focuses on the psychological aspect and really offers some interesting viewpoints on mental illness and the thoughts of the everybody in the world as well. It is actually an interesting film in that regard, but the final scene is where it truly goes off-the-rails. That final sequence that stretches into the credits is one of the worst things I have ever seen and really took the air out of the rest of the film. It was so bad, in fact, it made the film as a whole suffer. Fortunately, it is a really fun and horrifying time made all the much better by the fact that Reynolds is truly engrossing as the lead."" ]";5
1868;black-sea;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Featuring really good performances from Jude Law, Scoot McNairy, and Ben Mendelsohn, Black Sea is a well made thriller by Kevin Macdonald that manages to keep the tension high throughout. Though the little twist thrown in is questionable in its legitimacy, the film still manages to be intense and does a great job working in back story of its characters. Too often, thrillers ignore this, but this one does a great job developing its characters and giving them reasons to be on the submarine. So much so, in fact, that the audience really feels a connection to these characters and really feels for their families when things start to go poorly. In saying this, Black Sea is not a great movie and is not without its flaws, which  again centers around plausibility and some of the characters' illogical decisions along the way that you would be hard pressed to explain the logic behind. In saying that, it it is a well made film that manages to suck every bit of excitement it can out of being in a submarine looking for gold for two hours."" ]";5
1869;a-most-violent-year;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A definite slow burn, A Most Violent Year is an at times thrilling, but always riveting film. From the establishing shot, the first is entirely captivating and truly ropes you in as you become invested in the going's on of the characters. Interestingly, it feels like a gangster film with the way it is shot and the way in which things occur, even though it is not, which I believe to be intentional due to the way the characters toe that line throughout. The film is gorgeously shot, as anticipated. Truly, it has to be one of the most beautiful films I have watched recently and one of the best examples of cinematography this decade. Honestly, it is ravishing. The acting equals the brilliance of the camera work as well, thanks to stellar performances from Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo, and the rest of the cast. If Isaac does not become recognized as one of the best actors of this generation soon, I may cry. The same goes for director J.C. Chandor who has to be one of the best directors working right now. Following up top-notch films in Margin Call and All Is Lost with this flick is impeccable. I am eagerly anticipating what he puts together next and he certainly is a talent that is demanding to be focused on. One of the top films of 2014, A Most Violent Year flew painfully under-the-radar and demands to be watched."" ]";5

If I was rating this based on special effects alone, it'd be an easy 10. However, I'm not. The story left much to be desired and while insprirational and touching, it was not that amazing. Sandra Bullock left much to be desired in terms of acting, while George Clooney honestly stole the show completely for me. He was phenomenal in this film. Certainly worthy of the Oscars it could receive for direction and others, but leave the acting ones for some of the better performances of the year, in my opinion."" ]";5
1871;timbuktu;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""A stirring and incredibly timely film, Timbuktu may be a bit too slow for many moviegoers, but if you can dig it, you will find one of the best films of 2014. Brilliantly written and incredibly emotional, Timbuktu is incredibly well-directed and its heartbreaking story will resonate with everybody, no matter your stance on the Middle East and the issues surrounding it. By all measures, Timbuktu is an astonishing achievement from director Abderrahmane Sissako that does a great job of putting a face to the people of these oft-forgotten nations. As it often brought up in the film, you must realize these are people with children, just like people here. These kids are the center of their worlds and though their surroundings can be crazy at times, the people there are truly victims of the situation and deserve to be seen as such. Overall, Timbuktu is an impeccable well-made film that also really stirs you up emotionally and the end result is a fantastic piece of cinema."" ]";5
1872;the-imitation-game;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""It is almost always a challenge to wring excitement and drama out of a real life story. Yet, The Imitation Game does it with quiet assurance and ease. Director Morten Tyldum continues to demonstrate his skill in the director's chair here, though the real stars are Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, who are simply delightful in the lead roles. Cumberbatch embodies Alan Turing and turns in an emotionally devastating and touching performance that shows both the uniqueness and brilliance of the man, while also accurately portraying the injustice he faced. The Imitation Game is a very well-written film that is a very moving and thrilling experience that encapsulates Alan Turing, his accomplishments, and his struggles. Overall, The Imitation Game is a very good film that operates both as a good biopic and a good drama."" ]";5
1873;chappie;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""After the largely negative reviews, I figured I would wait to catch Chappie until it came out on DVD and I am bummed to have waited so long. I have no idea why the critics hated it so much. No, it is not as good as District 9, but it is still a good action science fiction movie from a guy, Neill Blomkamp, who seems to be quite adept at making socially conscious action movies. But heck, don't listen to me, I liked Elysium too. To me, Blomkamp is a very good director who is very ambitious in his films. They do not match his ambitions more often than not, but the end result is also quite positive. The themes here are similar to the rest of his films and Johannesburg will certainly continue to be viewed negatively worldwide due to its portrayal here, but all the same, it is a very fun and well made film. The cast as a whole is good and quite believable in all of their roles. I know Die Antwoord got a lot of criticism for their performances, but I truly believed them and they did not stick out at all. The development of Chappie was great and he is certainly one of the best characters in a film in recent times, in my humble opinion. The film really delivers in the heady sci-fi elements viewers come to expect from the genre (as well as a ton of Biblical elements, such as \""genisis\"" and referring to the guy who created Chappie as his \""maker\"", plus some characters being obviously religious). The action is well done and the film can be quite adorable (thanks to Chappie) and funny throughout. It is also oddly touching, as it always amazes me how much I can be made to care about a robot. Overall, Chappie does have flaws, namely in the way of plotholes or points where it feels like the story just skipped ahead a bit. It also manages to cram a lot into a short time period, which is a unique criticism, but one I feel is justified. All the same, Blomkamp's films always are very sleek and stylish and the way the robots are designed is super cool (just as the aliens in District 9's design was great). As a whole, Chappie was unfairly torn apart for some of its flaws, while many ignored the many positives it delivered. Not as good as District 9, but Blomkamp certainly took a step back in that direction here, as it is better than Elysium. Definitely looking forward to his Alien film (hopefully set in Joburg, because why not)."" ]";5
1874;boyhood;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""If you asked me to name one movie similar to Boyhood, I simply could not think of something. Sure, many of the events here have been depicted before and the whole coming of age thing has been done to death, but man, it has never been done like this before. Sporting a killer soundtrack to guide us as we trek through Mason Jr's formative years, Boyhood is a slice of life film like never before. Things happen for no reason, things come and go, and things fall apart out of thin air, just like real life. This film is extraordinary for many reasons, one of which has to be the way it was filmed. You do not see films made over the course of 12 years and to see this only helps it be all more powerful. As we grow up with the actors throughout the film, you truly feel like you are almost watching a documentary on these people's lives, which is an incredible feeling .In addition, it just felt unique and was amazing to watch unfold. In addition, it does not try to create drama. Life is not perfect and things happen randomly, people drift off for no reason at all and you have no idea why and you never see them again. This film is exactly like that and makes no attempts to \""Hollywood\"" things up by tying up all the loose ends, instead it leaves them as is. Plus, one cannot forget that this isn't their whole story; this is only a 12 year period in their lives. Who knows where their stories will end up? The writing is incredible, as is the direction from Richard Linklater, who is a true visionary and has undoubtedly created his magnum opus with this project. The acting from Ellar Coltrane, Patrica Arquette, Ethan Hawke, and the only cast, is incredible. The chemistry and familiar relationships felt so real and authentic. The situations rang true and ultimately made this one feel as though the most authentic coming of age film I have ever seen. There were no one dimensional characters and everyone had a story to tell, just like in real life."", """", ""Above all though, I have to say one of the best parts of this film has to be the quotes, in particular one that stood out to me, \""I thought there'd be more.\"" Just impeccable writing that manages to sum up what it is to be at that point so well, although I personally have not gotten there, I can sympathize with that line and its meaning. Ultimately, Boyhood deserves the accolades bestowed upon it and is one of the best films of 2014 and will undoubtedly be hailed as a film for the ages. Wow."" ]";5
1875;interstellar;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""There are many things here in Interstellar that work very well and some that...fall short. However, as a whole, Interstellar is a major success. First off, the visual effects are...breathtaking. It owes a lot to films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, especially some of the visual splendor that was on screen, but there was certainly some influence from lesser known films such as The Fountain. Some of the sequences in that film are almost perfectly emulated here, with some obvious changes, but the influence is obvious in that sense. Many of the sci-fi elements are also indebted to films such as 2001 and other far-reaching and technically brilliant sci-fi films. Sci-fi film wise, this one travels very little new ground. The score here by Hans Zimmer is perfect and truly served as a great sonic backdrop for the visual ecstasy that was taking place on screen. Interstellar is also a very emotional film, brought to life by strong writing and, in particular, strong acting. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant, as are Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, and Matt Damon. They all play great emotional roles here and it is hard to fight back tears at times. There are a ton of brilliant elements here contained here and the space visuals are king of that, but I do feel the story faltered at times. Namely, the ending seemed...cop outish. They kind of a held your hand a little bit at the end and pointed directly at what you needed to understand. It also ended very sentimentally and it could have gone in a far different direction and, to me, the ending seemed fake. Finally, there are some things that just do not make sense in terms of plot (plotholes, somewhat) that are not overly important because I barely remember them already, but all the same. In terms of science, it also seemed to try and go too far and get technical with science stuff, which was unnecessary and, largely, out of mental grasp, which was a bummer."", """", ""Overall, Interstellar is an astounding achievement technically and visually, though it is far from perfect and rather than blasting it for its imperfections, I think perfections need to be celebrated thanks to the profound impact have on the viewer and kind of leave in a trance as the final credits start rolling."" ]";5
1876;love-mercy;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""This biography of Brian Wilson is quite good, largely thanks to the acting. As the young Brian Wilson, Paul Dano brilliantly portrays his slowly emerging madness, while as the older version, John Cusack is perfect as the sick and abused Wilson. Paul Giammati and Elisabeth Banks are also very, very strong in this one. As with all music biographies, the music winds up being one of the highlights. Getting to see classic songs being made is a really cool experience, even if it is just a reenactment. The way the old scenes of them in the studio are shot is really well done, as it looks like old footage you would see on a music documentary. This one is pretty well written, though I did not feel it was overly inventive with the music biography genre, as many reviews state it was. While not entirely conventional, I did not think it differed too much from that formula, even though I really do enjoy the formula. As a whole, Love & Mercy is a good film that will likely get lost in the shuffle of 2015, which is too bad since Dano and Cusack deserve some kind of recognition for their performances."" ]";5
1877;mr-mrs-smith;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""One of my favorite sub-genres has to be the high budget adult action comedy. Unfortunately, it is mostly dead nowadays aside from the release of films such as The Nice Guys this year. They do not resort to low brow humor, put the characters in adult situations, and are perfect examples of the fact that even adults can appreciate some well executed explosions. Plus, there is just something right about Angelina Jolie in a dominatrix outfit snapping a guy's neck. In Mr. & Mrs. Smith, director Doug Liman takes a married couple and makes them both assassins who have been contracted to kill one another. With well executed action set pieces and great comedy, the film's appeal largely rides on it being about a married couple assigned to kill one another. As such, they try to outwit and outsmart another while doing doing so as a married couple living in the suburbs, thus they fight about curtains, comment about homegoods stores, eat bad dinners together, and the man breaks stuff in the house accidentally. For many, this humor may become tiresome, but it always felt fresh and acted as a larger comment on marriage, rather than just a source of comedy."", ""Pairing together Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the film that brought them together, Mr. & Mrs. Smith depicts a married couple that is going through a rough patch. With a lack of sex and chemistry at the time, the duo are having troubles. What better way to fix a marriage than by blowing up your home and trying to kill one another in the process? Honestly, it seemed pretty cathartic and makes you wonder why more couples do not try this strategy out. While a bit absurd, Liman laces the action and silly plot with witty and quick jabs and banter between the couple. As a result, their antics become incredibly endearing and deeply funny. Of course, this would not be possible without top-notch performances from Pitt and Jolie who not only have great chemistry with one another, but have tremendous charisma."", ""Of course, it is hard to defend this film. Inherently stupid and over-the-top, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is hardly a classic. That said, it is a terrific blend of action and comedy. For somebody that has been accused of hating fun, this review should defeat those accusations. At the end of the day, I like good action and good comedy. If an action scene thrills me and jokes make me laugh, then I am satisfied. While its gags are silly and it has far too many explosions, its tongue-in-cheek action scenes that parody marriage, relationship warfare, and other action films, it was hard to not fall into the film's charm. Its jokes are well-written, smart, and incredibly witty. They may be a bit silly, but they are never trying too hard, being raunchy for the sake of being raunchy, or giving into lowest common denominator type humor (Deadpool or Kingsman as negative examples here). Instead, it takes an adult approach and finds  a balance in appealing to both adults and action junkies along the way. Hardly the pinnacle of cinema, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a fun, well plotted, funny, and action-packed summer action flick. With top-notch performances from the always charismatic Brangelina, the film has a lot of fun with its over-the-top action, well-timed comedy, and smart/witty jokes. Gleefully boisterous and absurd throughout, the film's pacing is excellent and keeps the speed at cruise control. It is never distractingly fast, nor is it ever too slow. Instead, it flies by at the right speed to allow full enjoyment of its infectious energy and joy. While many do not like Mr. & Mrs. Smith, count me as one of its supporters, though its flaws are certainly readily apparent and the film is hardly as well manicured as its stars."" ]";5

Starring Shameik Moore is a fantastic lead performance, the film has some great acting performances from not just Moore, but also Tony Revolori, Kiersey Clemons, Zoe Kravitz, Blake Anderson, ASAP Rocky, and Keith Stanfield. Very well-written, the plot can be a bit outlandish and is ultimately the main detraction I have for the film. It is simply too neat and tidy to be seen as ringing true. However, the situations our protagonist finds himself in and the overall message and themes presented by the film are incredibly important and certainly resonate quite strongly as you watch this one unfold. The characterization and writing of the characters is why I commend the script and the way it unfolds. The plot is secondary and the real stars are our protagonists, who are wonderfully crafted and certainly ring true. An interesting coming of age film that blends together many different genres (kind of like hip-hop) into one compelling piece of entertainment, Dope is a good film that really demonstrates the talents of its cast and its writer/director Rick Famuyiwa."" ]";5

Instead, I saw it as a compelling film with interesting characters and thoughtful ruminations on survival, religion (especially during turmoil), romance, and relationships. Brilliantly directed by Craig Zobel, this one deserves more attention than it has received, especially because of the gorgeous cinematography and fantastic acting from Margot Robbie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Chris Pine. Z for Zachariah is a compelling human drama and character study that avoids falling into the stereotypes of the post-apocalyptic genre. Honestly, I never found it to be slow, though its pace certainly is quite assured and deliberate. If you enjoy films about people and do not mind films that are more subtle, Z for Zachariah is for you. A thrilling, moving, and truly enjoyable experience, Z for Zachariah is more than worth your time."" ]";5

If you do not like boxing movies and sports movies in general, you will not like Southpaw. However, though I find the sports cliches boring, I do greatly enjoy boxing movies and Southpaw is no exception. A brilliant blending of the boxing subgenre and melodrama, Southpaw effectively provokes your emotions throughout and really gets you going. Honestly, I felt like I wanted to go out and box somebody after watching this film, which is a great feeling. Though generic, Southpaw has a really great cinematic quality to it that I can only describe as \""movie magic\"". It really lights a fire under you and inspires you to get on out there. However, it is imperfect. Aside from being cliched, Southpaw hints at some other subplots that it never really explores, making you wonder why the heck they were there to begin with. Fortunately, the direction from Antoine Fuqua is electric and really picks up where the script slacks off and, even better, Jake Gyllenhaal is phenomenal. Honestly, in a career full of great performances, this has to be up there for him. He is truly entrancing as Billy Hope and really captures the true essence of the character perfectly. You are rooting for him at the same time you recognize that he is incredibly troubled. Forest Whitaker is also very good here. Overall, Southpaw is your stereotypical boxing movie, but I happen to like boxing movies, so I really liked it even if it is cliche."" ]";5

On the plus side, Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller are really good and work very well together. They make for a very believable couple. In terms of Cooper alone, he certainly embodies Chris Kyle and just kills the part. He is fantastic. I really dug the fighting scenes as well. I thought they were all very well done and well shot. Dramatic, entertaining, and saddening, they all made a lasting impact that makes any scenes with PTSD very believable. The supporting cast was also relatively well done. You did feel that sense of brotherhood amongst the Navy Seals that made you understand the passion they felt for defending their fellow soldiers."", """", ""On the negative, I can see why many would call this pro-war and pro-America. A couple times for sure, this one portrayed the Americans as superheroes of sort who are indestructible, while casually overlooking the fact that they were all as blood thirsty as their enemy. They demonize an enemy sniper when Chris Kyle is literally the same guy, but he's an American so it's all cool. It is kind of weird, but is to be expected from a book written by Kyle himself. The pro-war aspect is undoubtedly entirely a Kyle contribution, due to how psychotic he was and how much he loved killing. While it does add in some guys struggling with PTSD and of course people who die or who are seriously wounded, the sheer joy Kyle gets from war is obvious. I would categorize this one all the same as anti-war, however, because of those aforementioned supporting characters who seem far more human and far more willing to show how war effects them. In Kyle's relationship with his wife, you can also see a lot of the anti-war element."", """", ""Overall, American Sniper is a solid war film that comes nowhere close to being as good as war films such as The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, and Saving Private Ryan, that deal with similar topics (obviously) and do so much, much better. However, it is acceptable and a good modern day war film, as the genre has been slacking of late."" ]";5

However, I love the commentary on what that means about her that is had throughout the film and the larger problems it likely reveals. In that regard, the entire relationship with Bill Hader's character is fantastic and feels real and authentic. Their problems and approaches are really relatable for most people and the film handles it very well. While I love the emotional aspect of the film, the comedic aspect really peaks with John Cena and LeBron James. Every scene those two are involved in is hysterical and a real riot. I do not like Amy Schumer's comedy and I was ready to hate this one, but this film has a real charm that sweeps you in and it avoids turning into just another raunchy sex comedy. Instead, it is a smart sex comedy that has some interesting commentary on relationships and sex. Amy Schumer is pretty good here, though I loved Tilda Swinton and Brie Larson the most here. Both were phenomenal and really stole the show."" ]";5
1883;queen-of-earth;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""It is hard to say why I like Queen of Earth as much as I do. The film is sort of like that person you are romantically involved with who you love, but they refuse to let you in and there is this distance between the two of you and an air of mysteriousness. This film, if you were try and touch it, would squirm away disgustingly, but then come and hug you instead. Queen of Earth feels influenced by The Shining to me, just in the general feeling it gave, not necessarily in plot because story-wise they have no similarities. However, the general feeling it gave me was similar and also the fact they both portray a descent into madness against the backdrop of a vacation spot. I feel as though this film drove me crazy, as I found myself dying of laughter as it ended, but confused as to what I found so funny. A brilliantly crafted and wonderfully odd and disturbing psychological thriller, Queen of Earth features great performances from Elisabeth Moss and Katherine Waterston, as well as great direction from Alex Ross Perry. Though I love it and immediately wanted to watch it again after it ended, this is truly a film I would never recommend to anybody."" ]";5
1884;pawn-sacrifice;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Though the performance from Tobey Maguire is fantastic and the mental condition aspect of the film is handled perfectly, Pawn Sacrifice does largely fall a bit flat. Though it is never boring or a bad film, it only rarely captivates and even worse, it is like every other biopic ever made. Following the biopic formula to a fault, Pawn Sacrifice gave me deja vu many times as I could have sworn I saw this film before, even though I had not. This is problematic for a biopic. Fortunately, the story of Bobby Fischer is quite interesting, the scenes of his mental turmoil are grueling and sad to watch, and the performances of Maguire, Peter Sarsgaard, and Liev Schrieber, are all very, very good. At the end of the day, I wish this one was just not so typical because it has a good story, but its generic nature certainly hurt it at the end of the day."" ]";5

Ant-Man does not divert from the Marvel script at all and certainly finds a place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (at least this one is self-aware). Yet, it manages to be wildly entertaining and one of the funniest Marvel movies yet. Paul Rudd turns in a super charismatic performance as Scott Lang aka Ant-Man and Michael Douglas is very good as Hank Pym. As with all Marvel movies, the villain is pretty non-descript. However, the visuals are top-notch and the special effects are very well done throughout. A film that works well as a heist movie as well, Ant-Man pleads for you to care about its characters by playing on emotion and family. Though this fall flats, the film is fun and funny enough to overcome it. This is in large part due to Michael Pena who is hysterical here and honestly steals the show. If anybody needs a larger role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it is obviously his character. Overall, Ant-Man is a well done superhero flick that will entertain people who like the Marvel formula. If you are tired of superhero movies, this one won't restore your hunger."" ]";5
1886;irrational-man;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""With each passing critically maligned modern Woody Allen film that I watch, it becomes readily apparent that I am an Allen apologist. Either that or his films are never as bad as many see them. Known as a legend in the world of comedy, Irrational Man finds Allen blending mystery - a genre who has some great affinity for - and blending it with straight drama. Though he is also certainly celebrated for his dramas, he had never really made a film that was a mystery and a drama with no comedy. Mysteries of his that come to mind include Manhattan Murder Mystery, Small Time Crooks, and Scoop, all of which included a heavy dosage of comedy. In his late period, Irrational Man stands alone as a film with no real comedy (Blue Jasmine is close, but can be categorized by some as black comedy). Yet, it comes with a plenty of that Allen philosophy that we have come to love over the years. Thus, though its genre may be a bit of a unique blend, it is always apparent that Allen is sitting there behind the camera, if the unique style and camera work did not tip you off right away."", ""Focusing upon a philosophy professor, Abe Lucas (Joaquin Phoenix), Irrational Man tells the story of his time at a small liberal arts school as a member of its philosophy department. Known for his affairs with students and having a rock-and-roll reputation upon arrival, Abe is now quite the classic Allen misanthrope. Detesting the world, having no reason for living anymore, and unable to perform sexually due to how lost he is, Abe Lucas is a man that just floats through the day and complains about the world to students. While teaching, he strikes up relationships with student Jill Pollard (Emma Stone) and chemistry professor Rita Richards (Parker Posey). Yet, neither satisfy him. He still experiences writer's block and drowns his sorrows in a bottle of alcohol constantly. It is only when he overhears a conversation in a diner about a crooked judge that is taking away a woman's children because he is friends with her deadbeat ex-husband's lawyers that he figures out what will make him feel alive again: murder."", ""Clearly inspired by the works of Alfred Hitchcock, Allen shows Abe Lucas planning out the perfect murder. A constant theme in Hitchcock's work, Abe takes pleasure in the artistry of planning out the murder akin to films such as Shadow of a Doubt or Dial M for Murder where men joyfully plot out what the perfect murder would turn out to be. Similar to Strangers on a Train, Abe reasons that he is the perfect man to commit this murder since he has no ties to the judge. Finally, similar to the murderers in Rope, he revels in conversations about the murder after the fact as people try to guess who did it and how it was done, all while Abe can sit there with a sly grin on his face knowing that he was the one who had taken out the judge."", ""This murderous pleasure may reinvigorate Abe's reason for living, yet the key to Allen's film is always the philosophy behind the killing. In particular, how it relates to Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative. In an extended classroom scene, Allen quickly briefs the audience on the concept that suggests lying, in any situation, is wrong. If you are asked a question, it is imperative you respond truthfully because one lie opens the door and a slippery slope begins where one must then determine, situation-by-situation, when to tell a lie. However, Abe interjects that it is a fairy tale situation described by Kant, one that has no basis in reality because any moral person would lie if the Nazis came to their home and asked if Anne Frank was hiding in their attic or not. Foreshadowing how Abe would defend his murder - that it was a net positive to the world for an immoral person to be killed by a moral one - the categorical imperative comes back when Jill references how one murder inevitably leads to another as he must then cover it up. This philosophical concept is what kicks off the climax once Abe realizes that he must cover it up as the police close in on a suspect. Anybody who knows must go and everything is on the table as his supposed superior morality and place of judgment are thrown into question once he realizes the full ramifications of his actions."", ""Though Allen is an atheist, this film is yet another late period work where he seems to contemplate death, religion, and what life means. Repeated references to existentialism adorn this film with Abe repeatedly declaring that life is meaningless, while also playing with death via russian roulette and alcoholism. Yet, the film's ultimate moral tale that we are not to judge others and damn them to death simply because they are immoral feels inherently Christian, what with the whole \""he without sin cast the first stone\"" portion of the Bible. Though perhaps not finding its roots in the Bible, Irrational Man certainly does apply this principle in formulating where Abe misstepped and where Kant's categorical imperative comes from: that we humans are no judg"" ]";5
1887;mission-impossible---rogue-nation;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation does not reinvent the action spy thriller, but rather takes the best elements of the genre and uses them to great effect, Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson have fantastic chemistry and both turn in top-notch performances. Simon Pegg is also very good (and very funny) is a supporting role here, as is Jeremy Renner. Super stylish, the film truly does come to life in IMAX and look sleek and is beautifully shot. Above all, it is magnificently choreographed. The action sequences are masterfully put together and look beautiful to the eye. As a an overall film, Rogue Nation is alright. As I said, it certainly does not reinvent the spy genre and uses many of the tried and true cliches along the way. If it was not so wonderfully done, it would have been a lot less enjoyful due to this fact. However, as it stands, Mission: Impossible continues to be an impressively long lasting franchise in large part thanks to Tom Cruise's refusal to age."" ]";5

Rarely do I ever feel my heart pounding out of my chest, but I was sitting in theater wondering if I was about to have a heart attack my heart was racing so fast, then just like that, I was fighting tears back. This film is incredibly powerful all thanks to the masterful work of director Lenny Abrahamson. How somebody can create a film so briliantly moving and beautiful I will never know. Truly a wonderful job on his part. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are both stunning and have fantastic chemistry as mother and son. In addition, the writing is fantastic. Touching, moving, and powerful, all of the dialogue really hits home and makes you sit back and think. Room is damn near perfect and deserves all of the accolades coming its way.

An authentic look at NWA and the hype surrounding them, the film works as both a biopic and as a drama. The acting, from a relatively unknown cast, is great. O'Shea Jackson Jr, Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, R. Marcos Taylor, and Keith Stanfield, all stood out in particular. Though very negative towards the police, the film does a very good job presenting the film from the viewpoint of our, admittedly, biased narrators. That is not to say I doubt the authenticity of the film at all though, because cops can certainly be racist, especially in Los Angeles. Overall, Straight Outta Compton is an expertly made film by director F. Gary Gray and presents Hollywood with a number of very talented black actors to now start casting in future films hopefully. Entertaining, well directed, well written, and well acted, Straight Outta Compton is never great, but certainly met my expectations. Oh and the music is awesome, of course."" ]";5

Yes, it is a gothic romance, but with it blending so many different genres on top of that, it is certainly hard to fit into any circle. That being said, I am more than happy to let it be on its own and just sit back and enjoy. Thanks to truly beautiful visuals, Crimson Peak absolutely soars and confirms my love of Guillermo del Toro's films. It can be truly violent a couple of times and does manage to scare on a couple of occasions, but its usage of ghosts in a non-scary role is truly brilliant. The design of the supernatural elements is great and they are certainly metaphorical of something, but I am personally having trouble placing my finger on what. Though it is not scary, the film manages to still be deeply unsettling thanks to the great performance of Jessica Chastain. Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston were also particularly strong here. There are numerous things that stand out to me beside these things, including the symbolic usage of bugs, the brilliant costume design, and the fantastic production design. The whole lore of the mansion, the explanation of the name, and my God the visuals. I know I mentioned the visuals, but the cinematography and visual effects were absolutely phenomenal. Those alone are worth the price of admission. Crimson Peak will ultimately be looked down upon for not being scary thanks to a horrific marketing campaign, even though its intent is not to scare you, which is truly tragic because it is a wonderful film that is masterfully directed by del Toro and has a powerhouse performance from Chastain."" ]";5
1891;zootopia;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Exploring racism, sexism, prejudice in general, acceptance, and following your dreams, Zootopia is a fantastic film. Consistently poignant, Zootopia's sole weakness comes in the form of it being mildly heavy handed at times. Without that, the film would be nearly perfect. The animation is beautifully brought to life and the voice acting is incredible across the board. Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, and Nate Torrence, being the absolute standouts on that front. They all brilliantly bring their characters to life with their great work. Additionally, the writing is stupendous. Consistently funny throughout, the characters are also well developed and the plot is compelling and interesting, yet still accessible enough for a child. That being said, the jokes (DMV, etc.) may go way over the heads of children. If I were a child, I would find it way less funny than I did as an adult. That said, Zootopia is a fantastic film that starts off Disney Animation's 2016 with a bang and sets a high bar for their release later this year. Wonderfully thoughtout and thoroughly entertaining, Zootopia is another great film to add to Disney's extensive catalog."" ]";5

If I were to envision the best possible product of the majesty, mystique, and intensity, brought to the table by boxing, Creed captured it all. From the brilliant walk-out music (the great soundtrack in general), the training, and absolutely stunning fight choreography and cinematography, Creed has it all. The non-boxing parts can feel a bit disjointed at times and then of course it has classic Rocky cheese, but it does enough to honor the original, while going out on its own. Ultimately, the fight for respect faced by Adonis \""Donnie\"" Creed is a similar one faced by the film as a whole. Fortunately, it is entirely successful in forging its own legacy thanks to the fantastic direction from Ryan Coogler (I would be hard pressed to name a better new director right now) and phenomenal performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. Overall, Creed is a great film on its own, but an absolutely phenomenal boxing film."" ]";5
1893;black-mass;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Overall, Black Mass is a good film largely elevated by the acting. While Scott Cooper's direction is tight and taut of the film as a whole, he does his best work bringing out the best in his cast. Just like his previous films, the acting is where it soars. Johnny Depp is stellar, Joel Edgerton is fantastic, while the rest of the cast highlighted by Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Jesse Plemons, David Harbour, Peter Sarsgard, Rory Cochrane, Adam Scott, Brad Carter, and Juno Temple, are all also great in the film. Truly, no one does a bad job, but those are just the ones who stood out to me the most. Yeah sure, I named most of the cast. Sue me. The film's writing is also very good and it does a great job telling the story of Whitey Bulger and shows his multiple sides; the friend, the father, the husband, and the ruthless killer. Great at capturing the visceral terror inspired by Bulger and the sense of fear surrounding him like  a black cloud, the film does a great job capturing the atmosphere needed. Another major strength of the film is the makeup. Both Depp and Plemons' transformations stand out the most, but they are truly remarkable and unrecognizable in their roles, while becoming their character looks-wise (and acting-wise). Finally, the costume design was also very good and looked the part. Overall, Black Mass is a very good gangster biopic. There are far better gangster flicks and far better biopics, but not many films have such a fantastic cast from top to bottom that knock all of their roles out of the park."" ]";5
1894;steve-jobs;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Steve Jobs is a film that has some flaws, but above all, it defiantly strikes home just how brilliant Aaron Sorkin is a writer. Steve Jobs be damned. Actors be damned. The film is all about Sorkin, which is both a gift and a curse. With every Sorkinism in the book (the film is 94% walking and talking), Steve Jobs is a magnifying, dense, and structural behemoth with writing that steals the showcase and refuses to let anyone else steal the spotlight. No matter how brilliant Michael Fassbender is as Jobs or Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, the writing is the star of this play."", """", ""The tragic flaw in this is that it loses sight of its main character. Though the film is about Steve Jobs, it feels oddly formatted. I am fine with them skipping over the reveals and just focusing on the background conversations before the reveals. However, it should have focused more on the aftermath. The failures, the personal turmoil, and Steve Jobs' firing more. It touched on it, but never with any depth. Instead, it demands Steve Jobs to show emotion and show his hand, but he is incapable of doing this. Thus, much of the film falls on deaf ears. It is cool to look at, well shot, well acted, and the dialogue is impeccable. But, it lacks any weight. This is why the best was saved for last with Steve's conversation with his daughter Lisa (Perla Haney-Jardine). With the weight that the rest of the film demanded, the dialogue in the sequence and the emotional power of it all made me want to jump up and celebrate. When Jobs finally opens up and shows his human side to his daughter, the film is a resounding success. The end shot that fades slowly as Jobs walks the stage and looks back lovingly at Lisa is absolutely impeccable. In one scene, Danny Boyle encapsulated everything that makes cinema wonderful. The cinematic strength and power of that final scene is unlike that I have seen in a long, long time. Immaculate is the perfect word for it. Unfortunately, the rest of the film just lacks any of that power. Not even a hint of that heart."", """", ""The film is unwilling to vilify Jobs as well for his inadequacies as a father and a person. Bracing the audience for every punch by reminding us just how brilliant he was and what a visionary he was, every time we are shown that he is an **** we still come away thinking, \""Yeah, but he's innovative\"". As if that is some accomplishment. That said, it does a good job capturing the two sides of Jobs. While they do not gel together, Sorkin captures Jobs at his most assholish states as well as at his most brilliant. It is hard to place your finger on the man, maybe because he was a diverse human being with two sides. Thus, my complaint may be silly, but all the same, it felt tonally off as a result of not following through with either the vilification or the celebration. Though there was some attempt at the latter in the aforementioned conversation with Lisa, it hardly makes up for the rest of the film when he treats everyone in his life like garbage."", """", ""On the positive side, there are a lot of strengths to this film. Fassbender and Winslet are brilliant. Jeff Daniels' turn as Apple CEO John Scully is as impressive as always. Seth Rogen is shockingly good as Steve Wozniak. Michael Stuhlbag, an always terrific character actor, is phenomenal as Andy Hertzfeld. It is a shame he did not get more recognition. Danny Boyle's direction is assured as always. Though, it feels very different than many of his other films. Trainspotting, 28 Days Later, Slumdog Millionaire, and 127 Hours, all had a similar Eisensteinian kind of feeling to them. Packed with conflict in the editing with scenes, quick cuts, and I do not really know how to describe it...an authentic feeling maybe? They feel raw, unfiltered, and natural. Steve Jobs is far more Hollywoodized with camera work more along the lines of the typical Aaron Sorkin film. Tracking shots like ones straight out of Goodfellas are the norm here and in his films as the camera struggles to keep up with the characters. Steve Jobs is a mirror image of all of his past works in this regard."", """", ""The writing is very dense and detailed, but so is the direction. The writing is obviously dense with obscure references and big words to match the brilliance of Jobs. The direction, however, is equally as detailed. One example that I feel brings this to light the best is when Jobs is arguing with Wozniak before the launch of the iMac. As Wozniak storms off after Jobs refused to acknowledge the Apple2 team yet again, the screen behind Jobs changes to the Apple logo and tagline, \""Think Different\"". A small detail in a film with many subtleties, but appreciated nonetheless."", """", ""Steve Jobs is a tough film to truly assess. With incredible writing and direction, is undeniably brilliant artistically. The film itself is wildly entertaining. Watching this brilliance, Sorkin's language, and Sorkin's conversations is never boring. Yet, as a biopic, it feels like it never let's you in. It feels too distant."" ]";5

The main problem here is that they tried to do too much and the story wound up feeling clustered. The special effects, however, were absolutely impeccable and completely mind blowing. The acting was solid and the action was well directed. My main problems have to do with the script, as it tried to be too funny, and the amount of characters involved. While the new characters were cool, not only did I not know their names (they may have been said, but I must've missed it if it was), but it just wound up feeling incredibly crowded. However, they did a nice job plotting the film and really did a nice job developing the new characters, while also managing to advance the stories of the other heroes. Their adversary is a worthy one, but at a certain point, you do want them to get on with it and finally take on Thanos. At this rate, it feels like that is 20 movies away, honestly. However, on its own ground, this one is a solid entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and brings plenty to the table."" ]";5

Matt Damon is fantastic, as is the entire ensemble cast, namely Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The film is brilliantly directed by Ridley Scott who's return to science fiction is most certainly a welcome one, as he manages to perfectly manage the blending of Mark Watney's colorful personality with the hard science, without getting bogged down in the details. I would also be remiss if I did not mention the breathtaking cinematography. The shots taking place on Mars and in the ship are perfection, as are the visual effects, which are truly stunning. One of the best science fiction films of the century, The Martian is an enjoyable, masterfully made, and visually spectacular, film that deserves its praise and will hopefully net some additional recognition for its star, who turns in one of the best performances of his career."" ]";5

The direction from Justin Kurzel is fantastic and really gets your heart racing at times. For example, the battle sequences are brilliant and as hectic as they are, they pack a certain beauty and elegance. As a whole, Macbeth is a fantastic piece of film.

He is a good director because when given any material, he plays to its strengths and lets the narrative and characters do the talking. He is not flashy and lets the film breathe, rather he is a confident, knowledgeable, and smart filmmaker able to make the most of any material he is given. Unfortunately, this also means that bad material he is given will be watchable, but still bad (The Da Vinci Code). Great material lives up to its potential and Howard's assured hand gives the film the extra push to become a top-notch film (Apollo 13). In the Heart of the Sea is in the middle of these two. A solid film that would have been awful under a lesser director, but could have been special with a great director, the film is a middle-of-the-road film with pros and cons."", ""In the pros column, we have the visuals. Painstakingly gorgeous, it is a shame that this film bombed because it deserved recognition for the cinematography. On land, it beautifully captures the whaling towns and the New England feeling of these small sea towns. In town, the browns and grays are gorgeous. Gratuitous shots of the ocean from  Owen Chase's (Chris Hemsworth) home with the green town on the side. With Anthony Dod Mantle's camera gently floating up and catching this beauty of the small seaside town in 1820s Nantucket, it feels practically idyllic. On the open ocean, the sunset lends beautiful oranges and yellows to adorn the film that leads to lush greens and blues. With long shot after long shot of the sun's orange casting down on the green and blue of the open ocean, In the Heart of the Sea is a painfully beautiful film. The cinematography gives this film impeccable visuals that feel like a painting one could find of ships in the 1800s. A true visual accomplishment, In the Heart of the Sea is a film that demands to be seen in order for every living person to be awed by the sheer beauty of the proceedings."", ""Unfortunately, this perfect cinematography is not matched by the visual effects. Compared to another film based around oil and disasters, Deepwater Horizon, the visual effects in this film are pretty bad at times. The whale looks incredible and, again, shots on the open ocean look great. The fire looks terrific too. Unfortunately, shots during the storm and while whaling are really ruined by how fake it all looks. It is similar to car being driven in a film from the 1940s or 1950s. It looks like it was filmed on a set, which is a shame. Similarly, a few action set pieces also look entirely staged, similar to the effects in a 1970s disaster movie. These moments do no just disrupt the suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience, but just look awful compared to the gritty realism of the rest of the film."", ""Another major negative for this film is the acting. In the lead role, Chris Hemsworth plays Thor. Pretending to have a New England accent in one scene where he says apaht instead of apart, he is fine and entirely palatable. But, either have an accent throughout the whole thing or just forget about trying. Sean Connery made a whole career on his looks, being cool, and playing every character as a Scotsman. Hemsworth can do the same, but he has to stop pretending. Alongside him, Benjamin Walker is pretty bad Captain Pollard, but nobody is as egregiously bad as Tom Holland. Every line he speaks honestly hurts. From the very beginning, Holland never utters a line with any conviction. He knows he is acting and we know he is acting. Shame the production team made the actors suffer so much (500-600 calories a day) to capture authenticity for such bad performances. Cannot say it was worth it on their parts. The only actors trying are Ben Whishaw and Brendan Gleeson, but as Herman Melville and old Thomas Nickerson, all they do is talk about the story and are not given much to do throughout. Of those who suffer, Cillian Murphy is alright, but even he turns in a lackluster performance compared to his body of work."", ""With bad visual effects and bad acting, In the Heart of the Sea is a film that simply lacks the depth needed to be a good film. Its story and characters are fine, but never as rich as the cinematography and painting-esque shots adorning the film. That said, as with all Ron Howard films, it is entirely watchable, riveting, and a film that entertains throughout despite its seemingly crusty and aged story."" ]";5

What really helps to elevate the film above its conventional structure is Sarandon's phenomenal performance, as she amounts to being a one woman powerhouse in this film.

Overall, The Meddler is a film with very well-written characters and good pacing that allows it to never bore you while also making you cry, laugh, and smile."" ]";5
1903;genius;6;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Personally, the phrase \""Oscar bait\"" strikes me as a terrible critique of a film. It is lazy and disrespectful of effort put into a film. Though a subject and approach thereof may appeal to the Academy, to label any biographical film as purely \""Oscar bait\"" is entirely reductive, pigeonholing it into a position it certainly does not deserve. The result of blood, sweat, and tears on the part of theater director Michael Grandage, to label Genius as merely \""Oscar bait\"" is disrespectful of the effort put in by Grandage and the cast. Plus, those who call it \""failed Oscar bait\"" further miss the mark, as not every film will win an award, nor is every film aiming for that goal. Rather, films such as Genius may seem appealing to the Academy, but there is a deeper purpose here. Not just glittery gold and supposed glory. Genius is a celebration of the artist, the dedication, and the harm it can cause for that artist in their life. Along the way, we get some good performances, brilliant cinematography, and great period detail, even if Genius' slight frame highlights Grandage's theater background."", ""Focusing on the relationship between editor genius Max Perkins (Colin Firth) and upcoming writer Thomas Wolfe (Jude Law), Genius is a film about how the two come together to formulate Wolfe's work. Heralded as a visionary, Wolfe's work was rewarded with praise and, as a result, Perkins essentially saw him as his \""once in a lifetime\"" author. Funnily enough, Perkins also was the editor for F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Seems as though he missed the mark there, but I digress. Following the success of his first novel, \""Look Homeward, Angel\"", Wolfe delivers 5,000 pages for his follow-up novel. What ensues is the duo editing the novel fervourously, decimating their marriages, but forging an unbreakable bond between one another."", ""As Wolfe's wife, Aline Bernstein, Nicole Kidman often steals the show here, however. While Firth and Law turn in reliably good performances, Kidman is honestly shocking with her brilliance and commitment to her unhinged character. Always brash and filter-less, Aline takes a turn for the worse when she believes Thomas has fallen in love with Max and, in effect, left her. Two scenes highlight Kidman's brilliance in this picture. The first comes when she confronts Max and reveals to him that she plans on shooting on person and it is down to herself, Thomas, or Max. Here, she plays the role of the broken wife and knocks it out of the park. Raw, filled with emotion, and power, Kidman captures the alienation this woman feels expertly. Secondly, when she confronts Thomas after the success of his second novel. Though he wants her to go on vacation with him, her explanation of her own journey to get over him when it became apparent he no longer wanted her around is both heartbreaking and moving. Kidman, once more, captures the power of the moment exquisitely."", ""Genius also excels with its cinematography. Two shots demonstrate the beauty of the film and the reason here is often the staging. Grandage shows his knowledge of the stage and translates it to camera perfectly with a pair of shots that stand tall amongst the crowd. The first comes as Thomas rests his head on Max's shoulder as the pair look at New York City. Matching period detail with the always breathtaking skyline of New York City, the moment's power is matched by the beauty and pain-staking detail of its shot's design. Second, when Thomas is stumbling home after being at Max's house at night. Silhouetted by a bright light pouring through the trees in the pitch black of night, this shot in particular in gorgeous and seems akin to the work of Roger Deakins in The Assassination of Jesse James in look, style, and execution."", ""However, Genius is held back from brilliance. Though well acted, shot, and a terrific celebration of the artist and their dedication to brilliance, Genius is simply far too slight and far too slowly paced. It is a real grind and yet, it barely covers much, as it jumps along freely in order to make up for its slow pacing. It is dense, much like Wolfe's work, and is an incredibly tough nut to crack. There are times where it drags immensely and others where it does manage to ride the energy of Perkins and Wolfe's encounters. Unfortunately, by-and-large, Genius winds up being a poorly paced film that may accurately capture the essence of its subjects, but largely lacks the impact."", ""Genius is a film about riveting people with terrific acting and cinematography. However, the final product is merely just an entertaining biopic that feels far too limited in scope and slow to really be anything long-lasting. That said, the vibrancy brought by Wolfe is inspiring and one to be emulated by writers. He often treated those around him incredibly poorly, so do not emulate those elements, but his passion and love of writing must be celebrated and embraced."" ]";5

These two - Silas (Nicholas Hoult) and Nia (Kristen Stewart) - fall in love and must try to subvert \""the collective\"" and escape detection to contain their romance. Impeccably shot and acted, the beauty of Equals comes at the very end and is what cements it as a good film. Though initially derivative in premise, the film does not focus in on the science fiction. Rather, it is a stripped back look at forbidden love and romance and the end result is an incredibly powerful and tender, even if a touch cold, romance film."", """", ""While its story can often resemble Romeo + Juliet meets 1984, Equals rises above this simple presence to look at love rising above all challenges. However, prior to this, the film establishes a tender and moving romance with impeccable dialogue. Often told through montage by director Drake Doremus, the scenes of Silas and Nia falling in love are terrifically written. As the film visually shows various aspects of the relationship, the dialogue overlaying the visuals highlight the discovery and interest one feels when falling in love. Simple questions such as, \""Have you always had these freckles?\"" or \""What did you look like as a kid?\"" make this relationship really land and feel thoroughly authentic. It is in here that Equals finds much of its power and what makes its forbidden element all the more foreboding. These are two people that feel something and the world is out to make them stop feeling. Yet, what they feel is no naked and real,"", """", ""However, the stellar dialogue in the beginning of their relationship is no match for the ending sequence and final shot. Having resolved to run away, it is discovered by \""the collective\"" that Nia is pregnant. Fortunately, she and Silas had made friends in health and safety who helped get her out. However, to do so, they made it seem as though she had killed herself. What follows is a Romeo and Juliet-type situation where Silas, convinced Nia has killed herself, chooses to get the injection to cure his \""disease\"". Yet, upon discovering that Nia is alive, the film really hits its high note when Silas begs Nia not to give up on him. He still loves her and, in spite of the injections, will try to fight back and show it, while still following through on running away. This leads up to the final shot of the film in which Silas slowly puts his hand on Nia's. A largely open-ended ending, as we do not know what will happen to them once they reach the \""peninsula\"" - a place allegedly inhabited by primitives - but still it reveals enough about the true point of the film: the romance. No matter the future challenges, this couple is dedicated to one another and will attempt to overcome these challenges. At the very center, is a mutual love for one another, even if both are not capable of demonstrating it, which is a truly beautiful conclusion to the film."", """", ""Coated in blues and drab whites throughout the film, Doremus graces the film with occasional bursts of orange saved for moments when our two protagonists look longingly at one another. The implication is clear, yet visually, the impact is tremendous. The color scheme is honestly beautiful to look at and highlights the depression, isolation, and loneliness experienced before emotions in the film, as compared to the constant pulse of emotion once Nia and Silas have found one another. As for the acting, Hoult and Stewart are astounding. Not only is their chemistry electric, but their passion and clear love when talking to one another is all the more powerful due to their commitment and delivery."", """", ""A film that rides of aesthetic, Equals is a derivative science fiction film, but it is not a science fiction film. Rather, it is a romance set in a dystopian world and its romance is anything but cliche. Instead, it is raw, powerful, and impassioned, which lifts the film above any of its major faults such as the pacing."" ]";5

From beginning to end, it was the film equivalent of taking said mozzarella stick and seeing how far you could pull the cheese before it breaks."", """", ""Starring Emilia Clarke as Louisa Clark, a lower class girl from England, Me Before You is a film billed as a romance, but for me, it almost came across as decidedly anti-love (or, at the very least, denying the power of love to a degree). The unsuspecting Louisa is hired to work as the hired to be the caretaker of Will Traynor (Sam Claflin), a now quadriplegic man who was once an active and vibrant young man. While he still may be that man, Will most certainly does not recognize this. For this element, Me Before You could often double as a harrowing look at how depression can consume you. From beginning to end, the audience is shown the life within Will. Louisa most certainly brings that life out of a him like a flowing river, in large part due to their delicious chemistry, but Will does not see this. Instead, he looks forlornly at his life before his accident and is often confronted with this element, whether it be through his ex-girlfriend, his constant bouts with pneumonia, or old photographs. Around every turn, he is reminded of who he was. It is this element that courted controversy as people deemed Me Before You to be stating that death is the only acceptable path for disabled people. This, to me, is misguided. Rather, the film is an exploration of the depression that took a hold of Will after his accident. We know he is still Will. Louisa knows it. His parents know it. Yet, Will cannot come to grips with this drastic life change. The end result is a film that showcases how love cannot overcome all. It is not the prescription drug that will fix every situation. Instead, one must love themselves when they look in the mirror. They must be okay with who they are, for all of their unique elements. Without this, nothing will break the hold of one's own mind."", """", ""While Me Before You's romance may be quite cliche and its soundtrack lifted from every teenage girl's iTunes account (two Ed Sheeran songs, including new romance film staple, \""Thinking Out Loud\""), but its thematic elements regarding depression and self-acceptance are so deeply moving, I can easily look past its faults. It is an imperfect film with a spotty performance from Clarke in the lead role, as well as a pretty nondescript one from Chaflin who is good, but nothing incredible. The scenery is impeccable and most certainly capitalized upon with some stellar shots of the views. Additionally, Louisa's relationship with ex?-boyfriend Patrick (Matthew Lewis) does nothing to make the audience like her. Rather, she is cheating on him with Will. This poor characterization is a blight on the writing and only exacerbated by Clarke."", """", ""Between cheating and incessant eyebrow movements, the film can easily become grating if it were not as tearjerkingly melodramatic as it is, which is fine since i love a good melodrama. Clarke and Chaflin have great chemistry, but the real quality of this film is in its exploration of this depressed man's last days and the realization that love cannot heal all wounds. It is like painting a wall to cover a hole in the wall. It may brighten things up or change things up a bit, but the hole is still there and must be addressed in some other way. For Me Before You, its guts in sticking to this life truth is impressive, but also thoroughly heartwrenching to watch unfold. Get the tissues ready."" ]";5

Telling the story of rapper Conner4Real and his past membership with the rap group The Style Boyz, Popstar is a mockumentary musical comedy akin to This Is Spinal Tap. Similar to that 1980s comedy classic, Popstar offers an insightful look at the music industry and the bloated ego that comes along with it for many stars. At the end of the day though, Popstar often feels like an elongated Lonely Island Youtube video that is not funny enough to justify the length. Never laugh out loud funny, Popstar offers many chuckles and is largely irreverent enough to be entertaining, but never truly reaches the comedic heights could have aspired to touch."", ""Starring Andy Samberg as Conner4Real, Samberg turns in his typical brand of comedy with Conner4Real being an idiot and self-absorbed guy who is treated as a legend of the music industry. Alongside him are the rest of The Lonely Island group as well as a wealth of former SNL actors such as Bill Hader, Maya Rudolph, Kevin Nealon, Tim Meadows, Joan Cusack, and Will Forte. All starring in largely small roles (other than Meadows), these characters do add a lot in terms of comedic talent to this film. In particular, Bill Hader's small role as a guitar technician for Conner that enjoys \""flatlining\"" is hysterical and the type of dumb, silly comedy to be expected from a film of this sort. Through The Lonely Island, there is obviously great chemistry and comedic ability between the trio. This often comes to light, but never amounts to hilarity and simply relies upon silly lines and small visual gags that elicit laughs, but are fleeting and non-substantial."", ""When compared to the best comedies of the year thus far, such as The Nice Guys, Love & Friendship, or Ghostbusters (sue me), Popstar's laughs are more inconsistent. Many jokes do fall flat and the film can go long stretches where there are apparent joke attempts simply through the absurdity of the situations, but many do not land. Compared to those best films, the film's dialogue is a lot goofier and takes itself less seriously, but has less of a comedic pay-off. Now, of course, this is not to say Popstar is not funny. The random humor of The Lonely Island does appeal to me, but simply does not lend itself to being a full film due to the hit-and-miss nature of this style of comedy. Fortunately, when it does hit, it is funny and when it does miss, it is not eye-rollingly bad or lame. Instead, it is simply a joke that did not work as well and the film offers so many of them along the way, it is easy to look past bad jokes and still get a lot of enjoyment out of the film."", ""As for its portrayal of the music industry, Popstar's storyline is pretty typical and does not offer a unique perspective, but it is an entertaining and informative look at the life of a popstar who blew up beyond the scope of his former groupmates. Becoming conceited and self-absorbed, Conner4Real discounts his past friends and looks down upon them and becomes obsessed with his success alone. This certainly has a negative impact on his own success and he is forced to recognize he did not reach these heights alone. Clearly, this is not unique, but the backstage look at the pop industry and camaraderie that can exist between performers in the industry is fun and says a lot about the current state of the music industry and its reliance upon concerts and social media. In this way, it does often function similar to This Is Spinal Tap, but updates it for the modern age and, in this way, it is a worthy contender with the comedy classic as both offer an engaging look at the state of the industry."", ""An overall middling comedy, Popstar: Never Stop Popping offers a lot of jokes that either hit or miss, but the hits are low and the misses are often only slightly off-the-mark. Thus, it is neither hysterical or appallingly unfunny.

Unhinged, yet entirely emotionally vulnerable, O'Connell shows incredible range in this film that really allows you to feel incredibly sympathetic towards his character.

Hunt for the Wilderpeople had me in stitches multiple times and, even better, had a terrific message about adoption, acceptance, and unconventional families. Starring Julian Dennison as the misunderstood and unwanted 13-year old Ricky Baker, the film pairs him with Sam Neill as Uncle Hec. Initially not wanting Ricky in his home, the bond forged between these two is undeniable. Plus, their chemistry together and comedic timing is perfect."", """", ""The film's biggest accomplishment is its characters. The script from Waititi breathes incredible amounts of life into these two oddballs who have both been resoundingly rejected by society, yet have so much to offer. The writing does a great job developing them as people that are thoroughly relatable, which makes the tale all the more heartbreaking. In particular, scenes in which Ricky is shown running away and being unhappy at his new foster home, are incredibly raw. Waititi does a good job to give them a light feeling, but the implication is truly heartwrenching. Aunt Bella (Rima Te Wiata) certainly helps these scenes, as her love for Ricky is clear, even if she just became his foster mother. Her joy over finally having a child she had wanted for so long is infectious and breathes life into the film even when her role dissipates."", """", ""Though two oddballs being thrown together is a typical trope, Hunt for the Wilderpeople executes it so well, it never feels cliche.

Unable to have their own children, they sought a foster child to fill this void. Though not everyone goes through this, the emotional impact of this reveal and the universal understanding showcase that these characters are real people. Authenticity in film matters and when these characters shown unhappiness or elation, it rubs off on the audience and their emotion is our own."", """", ""Comedically, the film is quite strong. Though there are quite a few fat jokes, the film never leans on them too much and bolsters its comedic offerings with a varied and smart take on the youth, people without a proper \""family\"", and people who live disconnected from society.

Given the impeccable cinematography in which Waititi lifts a page out of Peter Jackson's book and inserts shots of New Zealand porn, this one would have been incredible on the big screen.

Though obviously not nearly as good as either of those two near-perfect films, Imperium does touch on similar ideas of both and is packed with similar tension. Daniel Radcliffe is terrific in this film about an idealistic young man who is sent by the FBI to go undercover as a neo-nazi in order to find out their plans for a dirty bomb. Imperium often mirrors reality from its depictions of talking heads all the way to those who are actually willing to sacrifice their livelihood to accomplish their racist goals. At all times, director Daniel Ragussis manages to create tension and keep you on the edge of your seat as Radcliffe's character explores and infiltrates the various groups of neo-nazis. The character development is solid for all, but especially when it comes to our lead, who is really well-developed as well as the concept that the film uses to help us understand the antagonists. Ultimately, they are not too different from ourselves. They have families, friends, jobs, and regular lives. Yet, they turn to hatred through their own feelings of victimhood that they blame on others, which is truly a powerful and unique way of developing empathy for those who often seem so undeserving of it. Overall, Imperium is a dramatic, thrilling, and moving film that may not be the premier film on racism, but is a moving look all the same.

Though highly fictionalized, White Girl depicts an absolutely wild last few weeks of summer with doing drugs, dealing drugs, lots and lots of sex, and of course, murder. It is honestly hard to say what White Girl is truly about, other than the choices made by Leah (Morgan Saylor) coming back to her. Though it is her choice as to who to sleep with, choosing to hang around unsavory characters in all walks of life brings unsavory results to her, leaving her to put together the pieces and struggle to cope with her actions."", ""Starring Morgan Saylor and her nipples as Leah, the film shows her move to inner city Queens with her friend Katie (India Menuez).

What follows is a torrid romance between Blue and Leah, in which Blue plays the role of sympathetic drug dealer. A large well done character, Blue is brought to life by Marc who plays the character in duel fashion. Tough and hard on the outside, Blue melts like butter when around Leah. This is largely highlighted towards the end when he lays on her chest and cries. On the streets, he has a persona - one he opted to showcase to Leah initially - but when he is with her, he is transformed. Though this is a hardly original character, it is hard to deny the phenomenal execution of the character. Not only is he well written by Elizabeth Wood, but brilliantly acted by Marc. Though Saylor is terrific, Marc honestly stole the show."", ""That said, this is Saylor's show and she owns the screen. Magnetic, manic, and energetic, her portrayal of the ill-fated Leah is both tragic and often painful to watch. Though caring and deeply in love with Blue, she still sleeps around and needs to scrounge up cash to pay off a drug dealer and a lawyer. This proves tough and the film is very classic in this plotting. While White Girl is a very good film, its plot is hardly original and this certainly stands as its greatest weakness. Fortunately, there are characters such as Leah. A strong modern day woman, Leah has no shame from her action and owns them. However, her character's strength and power is no revealed until the end. After a truly traumatic experience, Leah is more reserved and withdrawn than usual. This sequence is tremendously brought to life by Saylor as you can see her struggle to keep the pain internalized and not just collapse on the floor in a pool of tears. It is honestly hard to watch with this element bolstered by Saylor's authenticity in the role."", ""All of this said, however, White Girl's plot is incredibly weak. Basically a \""get rich because I need money now\"" type of movie, it is incredibly unrealistic with its portrayal of youth. Sure, there is drug use and lots of sex. However, how many young people today can raise their hands and say they found themselves in the situations that Leah did? I venture to say that not many can. However, as a character study, White Girl is undeniably brilliant. To enjoy White Girl, however, you must reserve judgment on its characters. Rather than pigeonhole a character like Leah and ask, \""What makes her do these things?\"" The film most certainly punishes her for these actions, but they are not the point of the film. She is certainly a tragic figure and not be emulated. I am hardly justifying her actions in the film, but Leah is not a nonredeemable character. Instead, she is merely a child who has lost her way and gotten caught up in living life with new found independence. Though its situations are not authentic, this element most certainly does hit home. As a senior in college, I have seen my fair share of fellow students fail to cope with adjusting to college life and the freedom that comes as part of the deal. Leah fits this bill and, as such, White Girl is a representation, and is an exaggeration, of these types of young-adults."", ""Though I expected to hate White Girl and usually hate films so focused on sex, there is something inherently beautiful about this work from debut director Elizabeth Wood. Haunting, tragic, and an excellent portrayal of lost souls who have strayed from the path, White Girl rides on the shoulders of its characters, particularly Leah and Blue. With terrific performances from Morgan Saylor and Brian Marc, White Girl is a modern day tragedy, but one's enjoyment of the film solely depends on whether or not you are able to see these characters as redeemable figures."" ]";5

Plus, as a children's movie, pleasing children is undeniably its first goal, which seems to have been accomplished. Delightfully brought to life with great special effects, Pete's Dragon is at its very best when the dragon is being a dragon without human interference (other than Pete). These scenes are magical, adventurous, and could be used to make the Grinch's heart grow in size. The interactions between Pete and the dragon are truly heartfelt and could honestly move one to tears if they are not careful. Director David Lowery does a great job capturing this emotion and also does very well in moving from indie (Ain't Them Bodies Saints) to big-budget Disney. His solo debut, Ain't Them Bodies Saints felt like Terrence Malick-lite (namely Badlands) and had stunning cinematography. Here, Pete's Dragon is also blessed with good cinematography and shows off the Malick influence with a few shots above the trees that seem to show nothing beyond the beauty of nature, which is greatly appreciated. Now, on the negative, the human element is trash. I assume it was the plot of the original, but it needed a serious overall. This plot was cliche in 1977 with overzealous humans who assume the dragon is all bad and unnaturally evil, while a few are sympathetic and childlike in their sympathy. The human characters are not well-written for the most part (even if the acting is good) and it really pulls the movie back.

The Jungle Book bears its soul for all to see and the result is a truly touching and thoroughly emotional film. I honestly had to fight back tears repeatedly while watching, a feat that does not happen much. Yet, when director Jon Favreau is in control, this seems to be a regular occurrence. He honestly may be a master at emotional manipulation and touching your heart through his films, as evidenced here, as well as in Elf and Chef. Though this one is a big budget film, it feels wholly intimate. Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray, and Idris Elba, are all phenomenal here as voice actors. Neel Sethi is about as good as you can expect of a child actor. He never soars above expectations, but never disappoints either.

A beautifully universal tale of the connection between family members and between you and your friends, Finding Dory is a heartfelt and moving animated tale of Dory trying to find her parents after having a memory of them. While the film can be kind of silly at times, it is obviously an animated film about fish talking, so I cannot really complain too much.

Bad news though, the dog does die in the movie. Why must movies kill these good dogs? Apparently Jumpy's trainer is the same one that trained Uggie from The Artist, so you know that this dog knows what he is doing. Director Ti West respectfully takes a step back and allows the film to celebrate Jumpy's talents with him biting a priest, leading a horse, tucking himself into bed, and covering his eyes like a good dog are the true highlights of this film. No shame either: I skipped over the parts with Jumpy being written out of the film. I knew he was going to meet his demise and that Ethan Hawke would go brutalize the men that did it, so no need to watch Ti West drag that scene out far longer than needed (it is actually a few minutes long; Jumpy gets shot and then the really bad guy breaks out a knife after speaking to Hawke with Jumpy whimpering for like three minutes, so I skipped it at that point and realized I did not want to know what happened). Regardless, Jumpy is the real star of this film. Everything is just done to give him a platform to bigger and better productions, so for that, In a Valley of Violence is entirely worth it. Otherwise, it is just a solid film from Ti West."", ""A spaghetti western throwback with the plot line of John Wick, it is clear that Ti West likes Sergio Leone. The score is very Morricone, but worse. The introductions and font type at the end are very Leone. The introduction of this stranger rolling into town is very Leone. Only problem: he has a name, which is Paul (Hawke). He also talks way too much. That said, West does a relatively decent job of bringing the same sort of style to the film in this relatively straight forward update of a spaghetti western. Infusing it with comedy and graphic violence, West puts his stamp on the proceedings enough to make it more than just a straight stylistic rip-off."", ""As Abbie's (Jumpy) human, Ethan Hawke turns in a typically solid performance. He just goes around hanging out with Abbie and killing dudes who kill Abbie, so he does not do much here, but the guy sure can kill people. In all seriousness, Hawke is a very good everyman actor and this really shines through here as we quickly relate to his problems and past as a cliched Indian killer in Oklahoma or Kansas for the military. He has regrets and does not want to kill anymore like every other western protagonist, but by God, you cannot kill a man's dog and expect to continue breathing. I know if anybody touched my dog, I'd rip their throat out and make them swallow it. Now, that may go poorly since they would no longer have a throat, but the imagery is quite powerful I'd say."", ""Other than Hawke, John Travolta is fine and leads the way for the rest of the cast. He plays the Marshal who is the father of a stupid son who, along with the other deputies, killed Abbie. Travolta's Marshal tried to get them to leave Paul alone, but could not. He is a decent man who may have risen to power in the town of Denton by force, but is hardly an evil man. His son, however, is real trash. Watching him get the **** beat out of him with a boot was oddly satisfying. James Ransone overacts as the despicable Gilly a bit, but he is still solid. As the only other characters with any semblance of lines, Taissa Farmiga and Karen Gillan are really bad. Either their dialogue was awful, which it was, or they were just bad, but their confused delivery of lines seem to indicate it is little bit of column A and a bit of column B. Regardless, their characters were bad and they were bad in the roles."", ""Largely a cliche and run-of-the-mill western, Ti West has some fun, but never wows here. The film definitely thrills and entertains though, but it is ultimately a film that is largely just an above average nostalgia film. West clearly has some good instincts with the genre though so I would love to see him try to be less derivative next time he works in the genre, if he does. He is a guy that critics seem to like, but audiences hate and I have no idea why. His films, from what I have seen, are largely quite palatable and straight forward. This is just a genre film that is pretty harmless, yet some viewers seem to think it is absolute garbage. It is a well made, largely well acted, and thoroughly entertaining western. It is slow, yes, but all westerns are slow. Did y'all pop this in and expect Fast and Furious or something?"" ]";5
1915;under-the-shadow;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""From Iranian director Babak Anvari comes Under the Shadow, a mesmerizing and terrifying horror film with great social critiques laced with terror. Set during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, Under the Shadow is a film that wears a variety of hats, but somehow manages to have them all fit and work together. As a horror film, Under the Shadow delivers great supernatural thrills with a young girl who, as with all kids in horror movies, might as well be left behind to appease this supernatural thing because not only is she annoying, but she is already friends with the thing. Have to cut your losses at some point. As a critique of the oppression of women in Iran, Under the Shadow is smart with great symbolism and references to the plight of women in the nation as the country ditches the westernization of before and heads into full sharia law. As a war film, Under the Shadows nails the first-hand experience of living through the threats against Tehran by the Iraqis and the palpable fear whipping through the city. All combined, they make Under the Shadow a thought-provoking, thrilling, and USDA-certified piece of nightmare fuel."", ""From the first instant that the audience is introduced to Shideh (Narges Rashidi), we know she is different. Wearing a burqa as she pleads to be allowed to finish her education in medical school, Shideh is a woman who does not allow any oppression to stop her from pursuing her own rules. As the only woman in her apartment complex who drives, a semi-educated doctor who wishes to continue her education, and who works out to Jane Fonda VHS workout tapes on her illegal VHS player, Shideh is certainly liberated. In the country of Iran, she is a major exception amongst the women in her complex, being able to pursue many of the same career and life options as a man. However, her husband Iraj (Bobby Naderi) has mixed feelings, believing she should stay home and not be a doctor (which he says was just her mother's wish). He repeatedly accuses her of being a bad mother to their daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi),  which is just part of her oppression by society. After accidentally walking outside without a burqa, she is arrested and told she should feel great shame for revealing herself in such a way, as women should want to wear burqas and fear being seen without one. As the horror of the film unravels, she gets a fake phone call that calls her a disgrace and a whore. Though she may be liberated, Shideh's individuality and freedom is under constant threat from the systemic oppression that is in place in her homeland."", ""Thus, it is no surprise that Under the Shadow smartly has her and Dorsa being attacked by a Djinn, a mythical Arabic being that preys on what people fear. Though Dorsa appears to be the target after her beloved doll goes missing - the djinn allegedly take something somebody loves before taking them - it is actually Shideh who has been chosen by the djinn. Taking the doll to get to Dorsa and with the djinn taking the form of a woman who fills Dorsa's head with thoughts of how Shideh is a bad mother and does not love her, the djinn attempts to woo Dorsa away from her mother and, later, it takes Shideh's science textbook that included a note of admiration from her recently deceased mother (in essence, it meant a lot to her). Thus, it is no surprise that the djinn takes the form of a burqa almost exclusively. The only time it does not is when it appears as a man. Together, the burqa and this man symbolize the way in which society is trying to restrain Shideh and pull her back into line. She must focus on motherhood and being a respectful woman, which means no driving and no school. Her place is in the home and this attacking burqa seeks to cement her - literally, as her feet get stuck in a cement-esque substance that Dorsa has to pull her out of - in her place. As mentioned in the film, djinn present themselves as what one fears the most. Dorsa is not afraid of burqas or women, as she is too young. Thus, she cannot be the one under attack. However, Shideh is afraid of burqas and fears losing her independence if a new government or culture push occurs in Iran that sees her lose what she has gained."", ""Thus, it is no surprise to see the film set during the war as it allows Anvari to lace the film with a great atmosphere. As missiles fly and bombs fall with sirens wailing to warn residents to hide, the tension and fear of the moment is the perfect setting for a being driven by fear to arrive and attack Shideh's family. As people run out of Tehran and Iraj begs his wife to leave the city as well, this palpable fear can be truly felt is brought to the forefront of the film with it being able to operate as a bit of a thriller with this first-hand account of the war. We see the attempts to run away, the fear, and the attempts to live life as if everything were still normal in the city."" ]";5

Though the ending may be obvious, the final verdict of the film is not without tension and power, as the film still manages to create the proper impact of the moment. Yet, Denial is held back from being better for being very much typical in regards to both Holocaust and courtroom films. Operating within the confines of its true story, Denial is relegated to filling in the gaps between its courtroom scenes with prototypical courtroom drama interactions, as well as classic moments from better Holocaust movies. My tears and emotion over the Holocaust were present for sure, but the film never really built on anything that past films have not already dissected."", """", ""Yet, in spite of its typical nature, Denial still feels powerful. A court case about proving the Holocaust and honoring the deceased and the survivors, it is a film with inherent emotional prowess. Mick Jackson brings this element to life in the film and really showcases just how impactful this case is, regardless of which way the verdict goes. Should the judge rule in favor of Irving (Timothy Spall) or in favor of Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz), the ramifications of the case will be far reaching and could, honestly, change the past. It is through the importance and significance that the film finds its success. Riding on its impassioned telling of the story, Denial rises above its cliches and becomes a thoroughly riveting and moving experience."", """", ""This element is most certainly bolstered by the acting. Rachel Weisz is limited in her lead role, yet still brings the good with an emotional performance. Her overt passion shines through and ignites the same passion within the viewer. Her lawyer, Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson), has the same passion, yet far more subtle. It is only later in the film that we realize how deeply this case has impacted him to a similar degree as Lipstadt. Wilkinson does a brilliant job bringing this element to life with a typically great performance. As Irving, Timothy Spall is tremendous. He brings Irving and everything about him to the viewer with the end result that you despise him. Spall, though in a vile role, is brilliant. From his non-verbals to the nonchalant delivery of incendiary commentary."", """", ""While its cliches stand as its biggest faults, Denial also does feature a decent amount of filler at times, as well as oddly chosen courtroom scenes. Though powerful, there is very little actual proving of the Holocaust and far name calling of Irving. He may be wrong, but it takes a few court scenes for the film to actually showcase his falsehoods. That said, the courtroom scenes are still powerful, but a little left of center initially before focusing in on the important moments."", """", ""Overall, Denial is passionate and filled with rage towards deniers. It is this powerful approach that elevates it above its cliches and filler to deliver a solid and thoroughly entertaining, yet poignant film with absolutely stellar performances."" ]";5

Telling the story of a group of lost souls that party, drink, smoke, and **** as they try and sell magazines throughout the midwest, American Honey brings kids together from all over the South and shows the division that exists in America between the rich and the poor. Wrapping you around its finger via its excellent soundtrack, unique camera work, and its essence as a film, American Honey is a harsh and truly exhausting film to watch for nearly three hours, but is an excellent slice of Americana and the underbelly of the nation from Brit Andrea Arnold."", ""The real highlight of this film is undoubtedly its music. Pulling from a wide range of inspirations from country to Bruce Springsteen to metal and especially to hip-hop, American Honey is a celebration of every corner of America. Though most of the characters hail from the south or midwest - Texas, South Dakota, Maryland, Florida, etc. - there are some from other states such as New Jersey and California. With its characters and music genres pulling from across the continental United States and reflecting popular music from various races and income levels, the film may largely focus on poverty and whites, but strives to encapsulate the American experience and influence that has on everyone who lives in the country. With gorgeous shots of the sun setting on the horizon or lens flares where the sun seems to blot out the whole image, Arnold captures the beauty of America wherever she goes. Beautifully maintained upper class homes, rugged oil fields, and open desert, are all given their due and show just how diverse the country in appearance, but one thing remains constant: how beautiful the land is no matter where you go. Through her camera finding this beauty and the diverse soundtrack, Arnold always sets the mood just right to be able to soak in this beauty and celebrate the nation's diversity wherever the group of kids travels."", ""In exploring this diversity though, the film really explores the divide between poor and rich that exists in America and also shows where they are the same. From pampered villages in rich sections of Kansas City to the poor backwoods of Rapid City, the film never shies away from showing the divide. For the former, the worst thing that happens is a daughter and her friends dancing provocatively to rap music in the backyard. For the latter, the mother is too drugged to even notice what her kids are doing. This divide between poor and rich is also shown by the traveling band of magazine sellers who freak out at the big buildings in Kansas City. For them, they have never seen anything like this with little-to-no big cities in the towns where they live. Yet, what is always common is how everybody is out for themselves and pitying those beneath them. People with Christian bumper stickers blow them off, oil workers pay for sex from the girls, and rich Texans try to exploit innocent girls by getting them liquored up. Nobody has their hands clean and that is, unfortunately, what really brings everybody together: selfishness. This selfishness is often derived out of pity where some people either respond to the feeling by offering a helping hand and buying the magazines. Or, they seek to just exploit the people and take advantage of their position as \""superior\"". Yet, it is in the former that the film really finds its kind central heart. With characters such as lead Star (Sasha Lane), buying food for an impoverished family or taking care of kids that are not her's, the film shows what is possible when somebody feels not just pity, but empathy and offers a helping hand to those who are worse off than themselves."", ""Using unique camera work to capture everything, Arnold's occasionally hand-held camera in the van is really the highlight of this film. With music playing loudly in the back and constant extreme close-ups jumping from character-to-character, the film often feels like a home video. Casual, unfocused, and meandering, in this tone, American Honey seems to just be capturing events partaken in by real people at an actual point in time in American history. It is this unstructured approach that really makes the film feel its length and be mentally exhausting with very few plot threads that exist in this film to really weave it all together. The only thing left is the thematic considerations and beautiful camera work and, as a result, the film is one that really relies upon its tone to capture the imagination of the audience and provide the audience with the mental stimulation they require. In this endeavor, its hypnotic approach to filmmaking is mostly successful."" ]";5

A lobbyist is a person paid to convince members of congress, via whatever means necessary as long as it is legal (or not), to vote for a specific issue or cause. This is what Elizabeth does. Working 16 hour days, taking uppers to stay awake, and downers to go to sleep, Miss Sloane approaches her work as a surgeon would approach an operation. She is precise, detailed, intricate, and armed to the teeth with knowledge. However, this is only in her mind. To others, she appears to be a drunk driver weaving between lanes going 75 MPH in a 25 MPH zone. Yet, every move is calculated. When she gets offered a chance to promote anti-gun legislation, it is an offer she cannot refuse as it an issue she actually cares about. As such, everything is on the table to win, even her career."", ""In a powerhouse performance, Jessica Chastain stars as this DC lobbyist that is capable of swaying public opinion with the flick of her wrist and making politicians jump when she says jump. Every misstep is merely a calculated move to distract the opposition and she is always prepared for how to react to any countermove by the enemy. It is as if this were a book she had read before and was merely going through the motions of re-reading it to re-live the moment. Having developed a penchant for playing these tough-minded female leads, Chastain lifts the film up and breathes life into what is a pretty typical political thriller. Without her bravura performance, this film would certainly struggle. Yet, her portrayal as a woman willing to be commit career suicide in order to actually experience a normal life having made a positive impact on the world, is a nuanced and precise performance. Though Elizabeth appears emotionless and calculated at all times, she is a deeply troubled woman. She has no idea where the line between good and bad is mostly prescribed to the philosophical belief that \""the ends justifies the means\"". Yet, she is also deeply unhappy. It takes a truly brilliant performance to evoke this feeling without actually expressing it, yet her brutal antihero has just the right tinge of emotional vulnerability to make her sympathetic. She is seen as heartless and cruel, but in moments with prostitute Robert Ford (Jake Lacy), we see that she is not some black pit of emotion. In her private moments, she longs for a normal life and love, a world where she is not attacked for just being."", ""In its plotting, Miss Sloane can play out a bit predictably, but is always captivating. With some whip smart lines in its back pocket, the gun control battle is always center stage with Miss Sloane and her colleagues fighting against her former employers in the battle. Always having some trick up her sleeve to pull off the impossible, the film is entertaining political thriller that can often feel like a mystery with how it keeps the viewer guessing as to what trick she will pull next. Is this moment intentional and part of the plan or did she get caught off-guard and was forced to react quickly? While no political thriller is ever truly original, Miss Sloane's blending of the genre with mystery and this superhero-esque character with nary a flaw in her career and operating weeks ahead of the competition, makes the film's plotting captivating and thoroughly engaging."", ""Yet, this film is undoubtedly a character study. As much as it is about gun control, Miss Sloane - for nearly an hour and fifty minutes - refuses to grandstand. It is reserved and never loses sight of its central character. Cases are made for and against gun control and the audience roots for Miss Sloane and the gun control cause, purely because the film is written in such a way that she is the good guy. As an antihero, however, we see her flaws and her downsides and nearly wind up hoping she gets convicted by the Senate Ethics Committee because we have seen her willingly break the law, but cover her ass. Her brilliance is admirable, but entirely reprehensible with how it skirts around legislation. In essence, she is no better than a mercenary and fights for whoever pays her the most. Yet, gun control - for reasons unknown - speaks to her heart. Willing to work for whatever to make it a reality, this issue being the one that breaks her cold, black heart is a politically timely move in the present world we live in, but also one that speaks to her character's past. She denies having been touched by gun violence and does not reference it, but it is clear that there was something that made her realize that this was \""the\"" issue for her. Something made it click in her mind that this was a cause she had to fight for, no matter what the NRA offered her in return for fighting for them. It is quite admirable and shows that she has a heart (regardless of your personal stance on gun control), as she cares deeply about some issue and its impact on everyday Americans. They are not just data points. They are means to an end."" ]";5
1919;live-by-night;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Having read the novel by Dennis Lehane, it became apparent that any adaptation of the novel would have to be long in order to capture the sprawling grandness of the novel. From Boston to jail to Ybor City to Cuba, the book has a lot of players, a lot of angles, lots of action and moving parts, and a lot of subplots. The film adaptation sticks largely to these transitions and mentions many of the subplots without diving into them. This is both to the film's detriment and betterment as it often feels as it lacks the depth necessary to make all of its pieces work, but also feels like it is adding in too much. As many have said, making it shorter or longer would have been for the best. However, the final product - which sits at just over two hours in length - is very, very good. Ultimately a barometer on how much people like Ben Affleck, the critical and audience reaction has said that Affleck sucks at either acting, directing, or writing, or a selection of the trio. Fortunately, for me, I do really enjoy Affleck's work in all three arenas. As such, Live by Night falls right into my wheelhouse and, for the most part, works very well."", ""That said, it is hardly perfect. The beginning section, set in Boston and in jail, is rocky to say the least. For critics who do not enjoy Affleck, this early section makes it easy to write it off as nothing more than a derivative homage to old school gangster and noir flicks. With a femme fatale, underdeveloped morality elements, heists, a cop father, and brushing shoulders with death and gangsters, and doing all of these while smoking a well shot cigarette in a suit with a fedora, the beginning is derivative. It is also messily put together, typically shot, and poorly edited. Scenes smash into one another as Affleck skims through the first 100+ pages of the book to try and get to the good part. He sprinkles little pieces here and there to set the scene and tries to rush through it all. Likely, editing this portion was a real pain as it is the slowest part of the film and is entirely necessary. As such, it flies by and feels wholly inadequate."", ""For this who decide to stick around, however, Affleck delivers a tremendous gangster flick once we hit Ybor City. Charged with running the rum operation in Tampa of gangster Maso Pescatore (Remo Girone), Joe Coughlin (Affleck) is a nice guy. He can kill, but cannot live with the guilt. While the beginning is derivative and typical of gangster flicks, this section is hardly typical. Cruel gangster with a conscience has been done before, but not quite like this. Instead, he is an uncruel gangster who operates more as a remorseful businessman. His line of business demands violence, but unless the person makes an overt case for deserving a bullet to the head, he is hardly a gunman. Instead, he runs a tremendous operation and lives out the American dream with his best friend Dino Bartolo (Chris Messina) at his side. Taking on the KKK and the gang of Albert White (Robert Gleinster) at every turn, Joe is able to defeat all comers. He corners the market in Ybor City and, as the book explains more and the movie hints at, the entirety of the South stretching to New Orleans. Raking in cash, he also meets a Cuban freedom fighter who becomes his wife, Graciela Suarez (Zoe Saldana). Life is good as he plans on opening a casino to preempt the legalization of alcohol. Until he meets Loretta Figgis (Elle Fanning)."", ""The daughter of Chief Sheriff Irving Figgis (Chris Cooper), Loretta is gorgeous.

Loretta returns and becomes a preacher who commands a large congregation and builds up serious political sway. She also happens to be anti-gambling, as she views it as a vice and a sin against God. Though directed to kill her, Joe cannot. She kills the casino deal and ends Joe's run as the Mayor of Ybor. Why could he not kill her? Well, to explain that, it really dives into what makes Live by Night so good."", ""Early in the film, Joe's father Thomas Coughlin (Brendan Gleeson) warns his bandit of a son that we reap what we sow in life. Joe, a good man, knows this. He knows that his gangster lifestyle will come back to haunt him because of the violence he must commit to remain relevant. He kills people via booze, pimps out girls, and sells drugs. He is not a good man and this bothers him. As Albert White explains to Joe early in the film, Joe is looking for somebody to make him pay for his sins. Joe is remorseful and regrets his sins, which is why he cannot kill Loretta. He envies and admires her. She went to hell and back. She preaches and lives up to the word of God. She sinned and escaped retribution for her sins. She outran the rebuking (her father spanking her does not count). This is really underscored in the final shot of the film."" ]";5
1920;la-la-land;10;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Postmodernism is a film theory that suggests that there is nothing original anymore. If it could be made, it has been made and we are doomed to simply remake a once original idea in perpetuity. Postmodernism also includes ideas regarding nostalgia and hyperreality, positing that cities such as Los Angeles may physically be real, but are in fact, dream worlds that are not actually there. In Damien Chazelle's latest work and, dare I say already, his magnum opus, La La Land, this theory takes center stage. Presenting a world of nostalgia of past love, of old Hollywood, and of jazz, La La Land takes place in the hyperreality of Los Angeles. Though undeniably a celebration of the past and showcasing Chazelle's admiration for old school filmmaking, La La Land is also a critique of nostalgia."", ""To critique and subvert rules, however, you must understand them. You must embrace them and then tear them apart at the seams so that may no longer be put together. In the first half of the film, Chazelle does exactly this. With large, kinetic, and detailed choreography and musical scenes, the opening sequence is straight out of 1940s/1950s Hollywood with the golden age of MGM. On the wall of Mia Dolan's (Emma Stone) bedroom is a poster of Ingrid Bergman. Another poster in the common area of her apartment has a movie poster featuring John Lancaster and Ava Gardner. Mia works in the Warner Bros. lot across the street from where Casablanca was shot. She and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) have a first date watching Rebel Without a Cause at an old school moviehouse that uses film. The scene of Mia and her roommates strutting down the road is colorful, bombastic, and embraces the vibrancy of old school musicals. La La Land, right down to the details, is about old Hollywood. Similarly, it is about old school Jazz. Sebastian, a piano player, loves jazz and its history. He dreams of opening a jazz club honoring Charlie Parker in its title and replacing the bastardization of the music he loves with its pure past. With bright spotlights, a deep blue hue to the scene, and gorgeous suits, Sebastian's every look and action embraces the history of jazz. The film lush, jazzy score in these moments and its nostalgic song \""City of Stars\"" embrace this world. Yet, both old Hollywood and old school jazz are merely a mirage now. \""City of Stars\"" - a beautifully written and composed piece of music - is dreamy in its melody. It glides by and paints a gorgeous picture of a world that does not exist. This applies to the elements that celebrated here by Chazelle. They are in the past, though they can still be loved, they are not to be emulated. In creating this world initially though, Chazelle strictly follows postmodernism. He uses Los Angeles' hyperreality to create dream sequences that play out in real life. From Mia and Sebastian tap dancing with a view of the city beneath them or them floating up into the stars in an observatory, Chazelle highlights the city's dream-like state of being. During the entirety of the film, the city has a blue filter over it and the end result is that it feels distant and otherworldly. It never feels attainable and - in the minds of Mia, Sebastian, and the audience - the city exists solely in our dreams. And boy do our couple ever dream. Both have huge dreams and, initially, they encourage one another to follow these dreams. Mia follows her acting dream by writing her own one-woman play. Sebastian joins a band in order to raise funds. However, their obsession with the past tears them down. Mia fails. Her play is a failure and no one attends. Her only hope is a TV show that mixes Dangerous Minds with The OC and bears no resemblance to the old Hollywood style of filmmaking she so adores. Sebastian plays music in a band with a guy he hates as the lead singer and music that betrays the soul of the jazz music he loves. Both have sold out and have careened off course. Why? Because of the nostalgia. They became so infatuated with their love of the past, they tried to live it and become a part of the past. Unfortunately, time travel does not yet exist and this is impossible. Times change and things move forward. If you move to the past, you will be left behind in favor of the future. Here, nostalgia can be a destructive force and serves only to distract one from moving forward and attacking life. For Mia and Sebastian, their love of the past distracted them from their goals and, instead of working towards those goals, their reverse focus led to them walking backwards away from their goals. Their relationship even falls into this nostalgia, as evidenced by the very end. Chazelle breaks up the film into seasons, beginning with winter. Here, Mia and Sebastian are incredibly cold to one another and barely know each other. By spring, things heat up and begin to simmer. In summer, their love is brimming with happiness and joy."" ]";5

My expectations were misguided, however. A powerful, spiritual, and lyrical journey to find one's own identity, Lion is a film that snuck up on me, but left me in absolute ruins. The power of this film is not to be understated as Lion is a film that never ceases to be powerful and emotionally impactful. It discards the cliches, develops characters, and is a film whose emotional power is well earned and never manipulative. For a feature-length debut for director Garth Davis, Lion is a film with incredible strength, gravitas, and a film that is a full-fledged drama that shows the potential of feel-good cinema."", ""Refusing to be bottled into cliches, Lion is a film that finds power from the very beginning. Set in India, young Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is lost on a train and winds up 1,600 KM away from home. Home, a very small place in rural India, is the polar opposite in terms of language and build than Calcutta, which is where he winds up. Dodging child traffickers and abuse left and right, this sequence not only highlights Saroo's journey, but the journey of other children. As the epilogue describes, 80,000 Indian children go missing each year. This journey to Calcutta experienced by Saroo highlights the abominable conditions of homeless children in India. Heartbreakingly enough, there are a large number of them he encounters who are rounded up by nefarious characters. Even in the orphanage, the treatment is horrendous. However, Saroo's life is changed when he is adopted by John (David Menham) and Sue (Nicole Kidman). An Australian couple, Sue had a vision that she would adopt an Indian child and, sure enough, she turned her vision into a reality with Saroo. In his portrayal of Saroo, Sunny Pawar is brilliant. Obviously, he is adorable. But, he never seems to be acting. This feels like his life and one that he is familiar with, even subconsciously. Pawar cannot be older than five or so, but he is phenomenal in this film and gives a natural performance for a film that demands one. His confusion and authenticity lends the film considerable gravity, but so does the introduction of his adoptive brother Mantosh. Adopted by John and Sue a year after Saroo, Mantosh is broken. Whatever happened to him and whatever he saw has left him shattered internally, constantly hitting himself when he is upset. Though this is a film about Saroo finding his birth parents, weight is given to Mantosh's role in the film. Highlighting just how lucky Saroo was to escape his circumstances unscathed, Mantosh is a sobering adult. He stays away from his parents and Saroo because he knows how bad he is, which is heartbreaking. Divian Ladwa is brilliant in this relatively small role and makes the most of this broken man. The film, after initially showing Saroo getting used to life in Australia, jumps ahead to Saroo as an adult (Dev Patel). Dating Lucy (Rooney Mara), the duo \""meet cute\"", but that is not hard when Rooney Mara is in the film. Together, Patel and Mara have insatiable chemistry and the two work terrifically well together. Rising above the classic cliche of leaving Lucy as just Saroo's girlfriend with no grit of her own, Lion ensures that it is clear Lucy has a life of her own. She has her own emotions, passions, and interests. Suddenly, however, these diverge when Saroo becomes obsessed with finding his birth parents. Though perhaps going on for too long, Saroo's descent into anger, resentment, and panic as he searches fervently on Google Earth for any clue as to where his family could be. He resents himself for not finding them sooner and can only imagine the pain and anguish felt by his mother. The film is incredibly somber in these moments, punctuated by the score by Hauschka and Dustin O'Halloran. Nominated for Best Original Score, the score may be a bit too noticeable at times, but it is brilliantly orchestrated in spite of that concern."", ""However, the moment we are all waiting for is Saroo finding his birth mother. The moment is chilling. It is one of the most powerful scenes put in a film all year. Yes, it is manipulative. Yes, it is sentimental. But dammit, I almost cried. I had to fight back the tears to be able to still watch. The look on his mother's face, the embrace, her hand running through his hair and on his face, the little peck on the forehead Saroo gives her, UGH. I was in ruins. There is no way to deny this film's power in this moment. It may be manipulative and something out of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition after Ty Pennington shouts, \""Move. That. Bus!\"", but man is it ever effective. It is a sequence that has anticipation, power, and one where director Garth Davis steps back and allows us to feel the full power of the moment. Yet, he is not done making my eyes wage war on the tears."" ]";5

Toss in some of the best performances of the decade in indie darling Mud and HBO series True Detective and the early 2010s are guaranteed to go down as the most successful critical stretch of the Texan actors career. Since then, however, he has struggled. From Gus Van Sant's stinker The Sea of Trees to the mixed Free State of Jones (which, as a McConaughey apologist, I liked), McConaughey's live action worked has slumped. In fact, aside from an animated turn in Kubo and the Two Strings, he has not been in a truly good film since 2014. It may not seem like that long of a time period, but for a man who made appearances in eight critical darlings between 2011 and 2014 plus an acclaimed television series in the time period, it is a real drought considering he was in five films in 2016."", ""One can see what drew him to Gold. Directed by Stephen Gaghan, Gold marked Gaghan's first directorial work since 2005's Syriana. For Gaghan to get up and direct again, it likely had to be one heck of a script. With the project having roots in 2011 with Michael Mann and Christian Bale sniffing around it, one cannot be blamed for being elated to see this modern day Treasure of the Sierra Madre pop up with Gaghan at the helm and McConaughey in the leading role. The end result, however, is a rather safe film that is enjoyable, often truly engaging, but always a big sloppy mess. One thing is for sure though: it is not a mess due to McConaughey, who once more fires on all cylinders. He is, however, starting to lose much of that good will built up in the \""McConaissance\"". Should his next two projects, The Dark Tower and White Boy Rick, also be met with a mixed reception, who knows what the future will have in store for the man."", ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre this is not , however, even with Gaghan snatching the themes from that film of desperation, hope, greed, and dreams of striking it rich, and tossing it into this real life tale of two men who had fooled everyone into thinking they had the biggest gold find of the 1980s. A rags to riches tale, the film feels as though it is trying to play off of recent financial scam films such as The Wolf of Wall Street or The Big Short with the film being somewhat tongue-in-cheek and often told through narration. With the narration being in the form of an FBI interview, the film hardly earns any originality points. Taking the party scenes of those aforementioned financial films, blended with a gangster-style story of a man who strikes it rich, fights with his wife and dumps her for blonde bimbos, and has uproariously insane encounters abroad and at-home, Gold is a film that has been done many times before. For this, it is rather disappointing to watch in many respects given its general stale quality and the eternal feeling that this has all been done before."", ""Featuring a 1980s punk rock soundtrack that includes Joy Division, Iggy Pop, and Depeche Mode, Gold is a film about a moron and a genius coming together to strike it rich. The moron, Kenny Wells (Matthew McConaughey), is along for the ride. Michael Acosta (Edgar Ramirez) is a skilled con artist who, when Wells comes up to him with an offer to drill wherever, he opts to go 50-50 with the man and takes the financial world for a ride. Kenny, flush with cash and newly single from Kay (Bryce Dallas Howard), parties it up with naked blondes and has more play money than a man with his mental capacity should have. This punk rock party music accompanies these party scenes and adds this loose and casual nature to these scenes where it is easy to see that these moments are fleeting and the cash disposable. Kenny, a classic figure of a man who wishes to get rich but has no idea how to not be poor, rapidly finds himself in a position where all of the fame, fortune, and notoriety has crumbled around him. Right when he thought he was king of the world, it turned out everything he thought he knew could not have been further from reality."", ""The film’s clichés do hold it back as previously mentioned, but they are hardly detrimental. On the surface, its story and themes are compelling even if Gaghan breaks no new ground. In fact, in its depiction of a man who is just along for the ride rather than the mastermind himself, Gold does manage to set itself apart from any number of similar biopics. Unlike other films, this one gives you a hero who is an awful businessman and constantly makes the wrong decision, ensuring that the audience will recognize he could never be the mastermind behind this scandal."" ]";5
1923;manchester-by-the-sea;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Utterly devastating. Bleak and unrelenting, Manchester by the Sea is akin to being bludgeoned repeatedly by an axe aimed straight at your heart. Once in a while, a film will come along and leave me in a ball of tears. Films can only accomplish this, however, by putting the audience right alongside the characters and making us feel their pain and agony. Their pain becomes our own and it makes the experience feeling entirely personal. Manchester by the Sea is this kind of film. By the end, Lee Chandler's (Casey Affleck) depression became my own and, as a result, the film left me feeling heavy. Elegantly written, score, and directed, Manchester by the Sea is an operatic and thoroughly depressing film. If you are in a tough spot right now, either this film will be oddly therapeutic or just leave you wallowing in tears."", ""Anchored by an impeccable lead performance by Casey Affleck, Manchester by the Sea tells the story of Lee Chandler returning home to Manchester to care for his nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges). Thrown into guardianship following the death of his brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler), Lee is divorced from his wife Randi (Michelle Williams). Returning home brings up various bad memories for Lee, which makes the journey especially difficult. Suffering from a deep depression before and during his return as a result of these memories, Manchester by the Sea is an examination of the grieving process and how we cope with tragedy. For Lee, he has turned into an emotionally remote man who can hardly converse with anybody else. As he blames himself for his issues, his depression compounds upon itself and leaves him incredibly numb. For Patrick, losing his father only has an impact in quiet moments. Small elements - such as the fact that his father needs to be frozen until Spring when the ground is soft enough to bury him - bother him deeply. Otherwise, he continues on with his life and finds things to keep himself busy. For Randi, she is still deeply shaken by her own actions, rather than what actually happened and how she treated Lee as a result. Both Hedges and Williams are tremendous as well. Hedges truly shines when Patrick has a panic attack. Here, your heart truly breaks and Hedges' raw emotion and authenticity make the scene land even harder. For Williams, she absolutely deserves another Academy Award nomination. She gets very little to chew on, but when given the opportunity in a conversation with Lee, my God. Powerful barely scratches the surface of this scene. Williams is a revelation in this scene and, in one moment, steals the entire film. As a whole though, the acting in Manchester by the Sea is a step above the acting of any other film this year."", ""In examining grief, Manchester by the Sea takes the varied approaches as described above. Lee cannot get over his grief to the point that he can hardly be in Manchester. Patrick wants to continue to live his life. Randi is grieving the dissolution of her marriage because it did not need to happen. Though hardly profound, the film exemplifies that we all \""grieve in our own way\"". Yet, the masterful element in this portrayal is its division between the sexes. When Lee is down, Joe steps up and cares for him. He shows emotion, yes, but he is in control. His emotion is bottled up and he is solely focused on helping his brother through this ordeal. For Lee, when Joe dies and after his own issues, he bottles it up. His only expression of his internal anger and pain is when he gets into bar fights. Part him needing to find out if he can still feel anything and part venting, these bar fights exemplify the way in which men often internalize their pain. Similarly, Patrick is headed down the same path with few scenes where he lets loose. Otherwise, as mentioned above, he simply goes along with his life of hockey, baseball, band, and his two girlfriends. Things do not alter much for him and, outwardly, he is laughing and as charismatic as he was before. His pain only comes in private when things remind him of his pain. Instead, he seeks distractions and constant chaos (depicted by Lee driving him all over God's green earth without end) in order to cope. Randi, however, has hardly internalized her pain. Instead, she vented at Lee in the past and, now, cried openly before him to express her agony of what went on between the two of them. Not to be too stereotypical, but women are certainly better at expressing their emotions and the film underscores this. When Lee and Patrick are together, there is a mutual understanding that they are both in pain, but neither divulge or open up as to how they are feeling. When Lee is with Randi, you can see how uncomfortable he is with this display of emotion, even if it is what he needed to hear."" ]";5

Yet, you have graced us with the sole being of perfection among us and for that, we are eternally grateful. Amen."", ""Aside from Monae though, Hidden Figures is a pretty simple story. Telling the real life story of the black women who helped to put a man in orbit and land on the moon, it is an inspirational feel good story that is by-the-numbers. Shoving the story of these women into the feel good biopic cliches, Hidden Figures loses some of its impact as a result. Fortunately, feel good movies are always going to leave you with a goofy smile on your face after watching it and Hidden Figures fits the bill there. That said, do not expect it to be different from any other inspirational biopic you have ever seen."", ""Blending in some light comedy to brighten the racial tensions of the story, the film actually does a solid job showing the racism the girls face working for NASA. The film really defines the racism in looks with the girls being stared down upon entering any room. Co-workers assume they cannot handle the work, only to be shown that they can. Yet, first impressions often define treatment and the women of Hidden Figures are never treated perfectly by co-workers. That said, as a PG-rated move, there are n-bombs here, which leaves the film to resort to subtle racism. Honestly, this works better for a film of this type as, by 1961, the tides were turning enough to force people to not be so overt and brash with their racism in the workplace. Hidden Figures really captures this with things still labeled as being for \""coloreds\"" or the girls being excluded even when they should be filled in on the information. The film takes the same approach to sexism with people expressing obvious sexist thoughts that they are taken aback to learn are sexist. Towards the end of the film, Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) tells Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) that she is not racist to which Dorothy tells her that she believes she thinks that is true about her, highlighting the subtly of the film with racism and sexist thoughts. The film clearly tries to bring them to the surface and does, but the racist and sexist actions of characters in the film are often done simply because it was the way things were and colored people or women doing these things was completely unprecedented."", ""However, while the film largely handles the racism elements over it, it cannot help but burst into bombastic monologues about the ills of racism and the importance of overcoming it. These monologues are largely done by Katharine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) and Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). The director of the Space Task Group, Harrison lets the racism occur until Katharine informs him about it, at which point he puts an end to it. Clearly seen as a white savior of sorts for Katharine in particular, Harrison repeatedly makes large displays of inclusion, yet still excludes Katharine and kicks her out at the request of his superiors, in spite of her talents. He makes the most attempts of anybody to include her, but clearly does so begrudgingly. This does not stop the film, however, from using his character as a white savior to lend a helping hand to the disenfranchised among us. Returning to the original purpose of this paragraph, the film may do a good job at crafting the air of racism and sexism around of every turn. However, it lacks the subtly in its dialogue given to its black characters to really pull it off. As a result, the film plays out with Katharine just telling people off left and right. While she is correct and free to express her thoughts, it feels to in your face and overt. Maybe she was like, I do not know, but as a film, there are ways to show her fight back and prove them wrong without having to jump up in their face to do so."", ""Of course, these emotional monologues only further serve to make the film feel conventional. What good is a feel good and inspirational film without moving speeches by the oppressed? Regardless of whether the real women were like this, the characters in the film are pigeon holed into a palatable package that will not offend white people like slave dramas often do. Instead, these stock characters allow white audiences to largely look past their race and have a good time anyways, even if all the white characters are portrayed as the evildoers they potentially were to some degree. That said, the rise, the breakthrough, the challenge at the end, the fall, and then the final ascension to praise, are all tried and true inspirational feel good biopic cliches. Director Theodore Melfi ensures that this film hits each beat on the nose."" ]";5

Unfortunately, The Autopsy of Jane Doe gets half way to the end and then decides to just put it on autopilot with an asinine twist that ruins the film. Up to that point though, I was terrified. Ovredal set the perfect atmosphere, shot everything gorgeously with creepy lighting, and turned an autopsy into one of the most riveting cinematic horror experiences I have had. But then, like something out of late-2000s M. Night Shyamalan, he decides to add in a twist that makes you want to lay on the floor and cry out, \""WHY?\"" Honestly, Shyamalan may have turned down the twist and said, \""No thanks, that sounds stupid.\"" This is a shame because the first half is tremendous."", ""Adorned with gorgeous production design and creepy lighting, what better place for a horror chiller than a morgue? Andre Ovredal knows this and makes his old morgue setting feel fresh and new. It is a setting that is begging to be explored. How do you make it even better? Mystery. Not only is this place creepy, but Tommy Tilden (Brian Cox) and his son Austin (Emile Hirsch) are tasked with performing an autopsy on a Jane Doe. Found buried under a family's basement, the entire family was found dead and this woman was not related to any of them. Since she was buried under the basement, the sheriff feels the clock ticking to figure out who she is and how she died to satisfy the press. So, he dumps her body off with the most trusted coroners in the county to get an answer before morning. But, what they find baffles them and leaves them running for the exits."", ""Touching on elements possibly regarding the occult, these two coroners put their minds together to try and figure out how this girl died, but it keeps leading them to one to one conclusion: she very well may be alive? But how? She has been gutted and cut open. Her wrists and ankles are broken. Well, you will have to watch to figure out, but do not get your hopes up. It is a film that has all of the atmosphere in the world when it starts up, strong writing, good acting, and a killer location. The odd part with the ending is that is not even derivative. The final act is like something I have not seen before in a horror film. Despite its faults, it is most certainly original. Unfortunately, everything original is not necessarily good. The Autopsy of Jane Doe is very much an example of this. Its final act does contain derivative elements, but its reasoning is incredibly original and dumb. The cliches and derivative portions of the final act are bad, but not nearly as bad as the reason they are all happening. This reason truly breaks the atmosphere and leaves the audience wondering how it could have all gone wrong so quickly. It is an original idea left on the cutting room floor of dozens of prior movies."", ""That said, the aesthetic of this morgue is unparalled. The opening is tense, creepy, and truly sets the tone for a great horror film. I was all set to highly recommend this one, but not it is just a mild recommend to see something go off the rails. Had the ending not been so tremendous, this one would have a majorly disappointing follow up to Trollhunter from a talented and very promising director. As it stands, it was a good effort that shows why he is so highly thought of, but he needs better material."" ]";5

The direction from Alejandro Inarritu is fantastic and epic vision for the film certainly came to fruition. A brilliant modern day epic, the film's makeup is also incredible and the acting from Leonardo DiCaprio under this makeup is phenomenal. He does not say too too much, but he does not have to in order to deliver one of the year's best performances. Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson are also phenomenal and almost threaten to steal the show at times. Overall, a brutal epic, The Revenant is a tad long and can be slow in parts, but with brilliant thematic elements and the best cinematography in a film in a long time, the film is a wonderous cinematic achievement."" ]";5
1927;raw;7;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""Perhaps no viewing experience is as jarring and visceral as the one when watching Raw. A French-Belgian co-production directed by Julia Ducournou, Raw is a deeply European work with a slow pace, lots of ecstasy, open sexuality, and a lack of fear in showing shocking violence. A smart look at growing up, finding what makes you happy (perversely enough), and familial strife, Raw is a film that shocks, stuns, and leaves you somehow dying of laughter once it all ends. Above all, it is a film with so many occurrences that make you look away that it becomes hard to even say you saw the film. For about 70% of this film, watching the film through your hands or just flat out looking away is to be expected. Even then, however, Raw is a film that may try a little too hard to shock and stun its audience, but nonetheless, it is one that works with chilling effect."", ""Heading into the weirdest veterinary school ever, Justine (Garance Marillier) must embark upon a hazing ritual that includes having her room destroyed to get her to go to a party, being forced to eat raw rabbit kidney, being forced to have sex with some random guy while covered in paint, having blood dumped on her, and more, this hazing ritual is one that is beyond eccentric. Yet, it signals the beginning of her journey to self-discovery. A theme that is wrapped up at the end as she is urged to find what  works for her, what will be her \""solution\"". In essence, what will make her happy and feel satisfied in life. College is very much this place to discover this and if the school, the people, or the hostile environment surrounding her (even the professors hate her) and her cannibalism (a hyperbole for being different and sticking out) are not what she wants or one she feels happy existing in being a part of in her life. Finding people who accept her, embrace her differences, and celebrate those differences, is what Justine must find and her father hopes she will find. The only catch is that she is a cannibal. Otherwise, this is very much a film about a young girl trying to find out who she is and often being shocked about what comes out."", ""Often as a result of this journey of self-discovery, Justine often finds herself in direct conflict with her sister Alexia (Ella Rumpf). Rarely talking in the beginning except when Alexia forces Justine to eat the raw rabbit kidney, the two are shown as being siblings who did not really keep in touch when the elder Alexia started at the veterinary school prior to Justine's arrival. Now that she is there as well, however, Alexia wants to ensure that Justine has the right experience. Taking her under wing, partying, giving her a dress to meet requirements for parties, and showing her the tricks of Brazilian waxing, Alexia is often a rather good sister. Yet, as she hangs out and texts with Justine's gay roommate Adrien (Rabah Nait Oufella), we see the jealousy and rage come out in both of them. Intensely jealous, warning her off of Adrien, eating her finger (wtf), being mocked by Alexia with a cadaver, fighting her in public, and then waking up to a surprise left behind by Alexia, the two of them seem to be in constant competition with one another. A light moment of the two of them trying to pee standing up is even marked with the obvious battle going on between the two. It is a sibling rivalry at its finest and one that often defines this film and Justine's experience at veterinary school. Yet, as with any story of siblings, there are tender moments between the two that show the bond between these sisters. As a result, the film uses this absurd tale of the two young cannibals coming to terms with what they are and finding themselves as a way to explore the unspoken bond between sisters. Though they may be fighting and constantly in competition with one another, even unknowingly with parents or peeing standing up, there is a connection between the two that, when one needs the other, will always take precedence."", ""Incredibly brutal with violence, Raw - until the end - often handles violence very matter-of-fact. As they perform autopsies on animals or reach their hands in a cow's anus, the veterinarian students seem unbothered by what is occurring and the film exudes the same demeanor. Honestly, it may make this film all the more horrifying as it is positioned as being so normal and typical, with no pomp or circumstance surrounding each introduction of violence. The only time the film stalls a bit to let the impact build up comes in the climactic sequence and in the film's final act, both of which deliver a punch. Nonetheless, in this practically casual violence, Raw finds great horror. It makes it seem so natural to eat a man's bleeding head after a car crash or to bite your sibling in a fight and taste their blood. It is sick, twisted, and deeply unsettling, yet is presented in the same way as a coming-of-age story in which a character discovers a love of music. This disconnect is often what makes Raw so jarring"" ]";5

No matter how smart and funny it is, the cringey actions of Ingrid Thorburn (Aubrey Plaza) keep the film as being one that is often best watched through the gaps between one's fingers. Spiraling out of control as she stalks and befriends social media influencer Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen), strikes up a romance with landlord Dan Pinto (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), and moves to Los Angeles, Ingrid is a woman with a few screws loose in her head. A tragic figure, she serves as the gateway for director Matt Spicer to critique modern culture, celebrity worship, and reveal the damage both have done to those who partake or follow these vapid and fake human beings that proliferate social media. Equal parts funny, dark, and sad, Ingrid Goes West is an excellent feature debut for Spicer."", ""From the very get go, we are introduced to the world of Ingrid. Using Instagram extensively and being hurt by a \""friend\"" that did not invite her to her wedding, Ingrid resorts to stalking the woman's instagram, crying over the wedding photos, and then showing up to pepper spray the beaming bride. Locked up in a mental hospital, healing, and soon released, Ingrid decides to get a new start in Los Angeles after reading a magazine ominously calls Taylor Sloane \""your next girl crush\"". A classic social media influencer with sponsored posts, \""deep\"" quotes with stupid photos, and living in a constant state of vacation, Taylor is the perfect target for Ingrid. Working her way in Taylor's life by stealing her dog and then returning it the next day, Ingrid befriends Taylor and her husband Ezra (Wyatt Russell) effortlessly and quickly catapults to minor stardom after she is included in an Instagram post by Taylor. Meanwhile, she uses her inheritance from her mother's death to rent an apartment from Dan and abuses his trust by both taking his car all day, missing a planed appointment with him that she agreed to in order to borrow his car, and by wrecking that very same car. What ensues is an often chilling portrait of modern society and the damaging effects social media has had."", ""Chief amongst these critiques is Spicer's demonstration of how life is now lived through phones and social media. Part of it is certainly being obsessed with news and what is happening, but much of it is in the desperate search for affirmation. By liking posts on Instagram and commenting constantly, Ingrid hopes to create new friends and be as popular as the girls she sees on the site. In a life of solitude after her mother's death, this world of social media is her only opportunity for human interaction and she makes the very most of this chance. Yet, she is hardly the only one. Taylor lives her life in a similar fashion, yet is never called deranged for the same behavior. She lives behind a screen, posts constantly to remain popular, and forgets to actually live life in the process. Even worse, her world vision is so warped by social media that she convinces Ezra to quit his job to make paintings where he just takes somebody else's work, tosses a social media buzzword like \""#SQUADGOALS\"" on it, and then sell it for over $1,000. This constant and desperate search for affirmation in the eyes of followers, shows the dangerous impact social media has had on our world. Emotion, feeling, experience, and life, have become disposable. In their place, false compliments and shallow popularity have taken their place with people valuing themselves solely based upon how many followers they have and how many likes they get. Prior to her discovering that Ingrid is a psycho, Taylor is great friends with her. However, once Harley (Pom Klementieff) - a social influencer with 1 million followers - arrives in town, Taylor forgets all about Ingrid. Even her husband feels slighted by her new lifestyle, as she was once a normal girl with no friends in Los Angeles, but would now do anything for followers. By sacrificing herself and her own personality in the name of becoming famous on Instagram, Taylor has lost herself in this world and, for many, the same exact thing occurs. Social media has become people's reality with a phone not just being a device to call or text occasionally, but rather a life support machine that serves as a person's only connection to the outside world. In Ingrid Goes West, we see Taylor and Ingrid do drugs, blow their money, and practically sell their soul, to gain any semblance of popularity. For them, nothing is too steep a price for a like on Instagram."" ]";5

Do not get me wrong, I never thought it would be bad. But, I was never comparing it to some childhood classic that filled me with nostalgia every time I thought of watching the film. Instead, I saw this film in a vacuum. Unfortunately, it is still a mixed bag. At times, you can feel that fairy tale magic that is promised. Other moments provide sensory overload or are complete filler and wholly unnecessary. The end result is a potion that both enchants and befuddles in near equal measure."", ""From its very first frame, Beauty and the Beast shows its tedious footing between grating and magical. Its opening sequence of the Beast/Prince Charming (Dan Stevens) getting cursed by an enchantress has both incredible special effects and preposterous make-up. It is well applied, but it seems too exuberant and practically flamboyant with how much make-up the Prince is wearing to his party. That said, the scene still imbues the sense of mystery and magic necessary for the film and its immediate follow-up, the performance of the song \""Belle\"", really hits the mark. Emma Watson's singing is lovely as Belle as she goes through her small French village and the various villagers express their reservations about Belle and her quirky bookworm behavior. It is a real charmer and is a song that gets the proceedings off to a terrific musical beginning, quickly displaying why this film's music is beloved by so many."", ""Unfortunately, the film then takes some poor turns. In its performance of \""Gaston\"", a loud and incredibly well-choreographed musical number mostly performed by LeFou (Josh Gad), Gaston's (Luke Evans) closest companion, the film hits a real sour note. The song is simply too much. Compared to the more restrained staging of \""Belle\"", \""Gaston\"" is over-the-top and further maligned by an awful joke about the spelling of his name and LeFou's illiteracy. At this point, I was wondering if it was a mistake and the film would not be nearly as good as hoped. These fears were realized when we reach the Prince's castle. While the banter between Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) was immediately appealing, the arrival at the castle is marked by a few bad moments. One, when Belle is shown her room and the camera does a whip pan. Early in the film, during the performance of \""Belle\"", I noticed some quick camera movements that immediately bothered my eyes. However, I had ignored them because I figured that I was simply a bit tired. Sadly, this eye shattering whip only served to make my strained eyes scream out in anguish. My eyes were not treated kindly in the follow-up to this either with the performance of \""Be Our Guest\"". While the song is fine, the glowing sensory overload that ensues on the dinner table is just far too much. It had bright lights and excitement to try and attract kids to the joy on screen, but it felt far too hollow and bombastic to actually work in any effective way."", ""Fortunately, the film picks up considerably at this point as it begins to focus on the romance between the Beast and Belle. This is a romance that would charm warmth in the coldest and blackest of hearts. Via songs such as \""Something There\"", \""Beauty and the Beast\"", and \""Evermore\"", the film strikes a heart warmingly romantic tone that rewards viewers with the magic of a fairy tale, terrific songs, and an awe-inducing romance. Together, Watson and Stevens have terrific chemistry in these forms and work incredibly well with one another. Small moments of them simply walking into a library or over a bridge are moving, poetic, and achingly romantic. The film has so much heart, it nearly swells and boils over. Now, these sequences do have their flaws. Though the visual effects of the film are impeccable, especially with Belle's dress - a real highlight of these live-action remakes have been the dresses, as the realization of Cinderella's ball gown with the accompanying visual effects is still stunning to me - and the beast is also incredibly well-realized. That said, there are still issues with the effects. On the bridge, while romantic, it is clear it is occurring in front of a green screen. There are other moments scattered throughout that are unfortunately stricken by shaky visual effects. Fortunately, the whole romance of them falling in love is so well-written and realized, it is hard to deny the film's magic. Accented by charming turns by Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson as some of the Beast's cursed helpers, the film strikes a good balance between the more romantic elements and the comedic elements."" ]";5

While just his second directorial effort, Sheridan's voice was brought to life in both Sicario and Hell or High Water to the point that it feels as though both were directed by him. However, in seeing Wind River, the first film he wrote and directed (his debut Vile was just directed by him), it is clear that he does benefit from working with better directors. While Sheridan capably directs the film's strong script, it remains true that in the hands of somebody better, Wind River could have been a classic. As it stands, it is instead a pretty good film with great ideas on its mind that it handles far too bluntly at times. A thrilling and sorrowful film about a murder on an Indian reservation, Wind River works, but not to the degree that it should have, leaving it as a good but disappointing work."", ""In both Sicario and Hell or High Water, it became clear that Sheridan's thematic focus was upon the disenfranchised. In the former, he focused on those living under the thumb of the Cartel in both Mexico and across the border in America. In the latter, he focused upon those left behind in the dust by the financial collapse in the late 2000s. Now, in Wind River, he turns his focus on a group of people all Americans have contributed to the demise of: Native Americans. With a Native American girl, Natalie Hanson (Kelsey Chow), found dead on the reservation by wild life and game tracker Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), the murder serves as merely a gateway into the life on the reservation. For FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), this functions as if it were another world. Completely isolated and on their own without back-up, the tribal police run by Ben (Graham Greene), operates across a territory the size of Rhode Island with just six officers. With such little police presence, no opportunity for advancement via education or jobs, and readily available drugs and alcohol, the Wind River Indian Reservation is the quintessential depiction of life for Natives in America right now. With missing Native girls reaching astronomical figures, alcoholism running rampant, and drug use throughout, Wind River calls attention to the issues facing Natives in a searing, depressing, and realistic depiction. When handling these issues, Sheridan does so beautifully and skillfully, burying them within average conversations between Cory and men believed to be somewhat connected to the murder. In every home on the reservation, demons reside and it is best to pretend that they are not actually there."", ""Found six miles from the nearest building, Sheridan's ability to use the death of Natalie as a metaphor and symbolism for the life of Natives is perhaps the film's most impressive aspect. Dying not from being raped or killed, but from having her lungs explode due to the cold weather, Sheridan subtly and smartly depicts how the land has even turned against Natives after all these years. Through the turmoil and strife thrust upon them by the whites and their arrival in the Americas, Natives could always count on the lands to sustain them in their time of need. However, with such little territory and animals such as the bison leaving Indian reservations, the staples of Native American life have left them in the lurch to the point that they have nothing to do and are without hope. What were once proud people have been left destitute through their interactions with whites and through the changing of times as crops die and animals leave. While whites led them to their grave with a gun to their head, the land is truly what nailed the final nail in the coffin of Natives in America with the land no longer being sustainable. However, while the situation is hopeless and destitute - just as the one faced by Natalie with her having to run six miles barefoot just to get where she was, which was nowhere - this race of people that have been in the Americas for thousands of years refuse to give up and will fight until their dying breathe."", ""Sheridan, in the course of depicting how the land and circumstance is truly what is killing Native Americans, refuses to let whites off the hook. At the end of the day, the only reason Natives are in this situation to begin with because of whites. It is a central argument in the film that it is impossible to define. With the case of Natalie, she was clearly led to run in the snow by some malevolent force that is certainly guilty of homicide. However, the coroner cannot give the cause of death as homicide, as she died because of her lungs exploding. While it is true that it should be considered a homicide, that is not her cause of death. Though it may be true that the land turning against Natives has only worsened conditions on reservations, the only reason they are there to begin is whites, so how can the blame not be laid at the feet of whites across America who deny culpability in the matter?"" ]";5
1931;star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;"[ ""The Force Awakens is a great film. Not only does it brilliantly set up Episodes VIII and IX with some great story material, it has some great characters. Finn, Rey, BB-8, Poe Dameron, General Hux, and especially Kylo Ren, are some seriously great characters. Even more, John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, and Adam Driver, are fantastic actors and do a great job here. I cannot wait to see where the series goes from here. JJ Abrams does a great job blending new and old here by giving diehards the nostalgia they crave and giving the new generation the new adventures they crave. The writing was strong and the special effects were out of this world. The score was great, but should not win the Oscar for Best ORIGINAL Score due to just being a copy-paste of previous Star Wars scores with some new tracks alongside the ones of old. My main problem with Episode IV and then the prequels were the whiny characters and thankfully that is not the case here. At no point are they whiny and this really elevates the film. I think much of the criticism in regards to characterization and story are kind of stupid admittedly because this is the first of a trilogy. Of course nothing feels explained or fleshed out...there is nearly five more hours of story to be told."" ]";5

Thankfully this film lives up to every bit of the hype. First off this movie is absolutely gorgeous. The feel of the era comes through in every single frame. Spielberg captures the image we have of Lincoln as a man perfectly. There are so many shots that we get of Lincoln's profile or where he is walking out of a room and his presence is captured perfectly. This is also a perfectly written script. Again the language is written perfectly for the era and events that we are witnessing. Last but certainly not least the acting is superb across the board. Lewis is every bit of Lincoln that we expect him to be, he captures the image we have of Lincoln in every single scene. Maybe most amazing is that all the other actors never seem dwarfed by Lewis's presence. Whether this is from great casting, acting, or writing doesn't matter, all that matters is that it all works seamlessly. The only reason this movie doesn't get a perfect 10 from me is that there are a few scenes with the \""Spielberg cheese\"".

Park also uses the split screen masterfully in this movie. This is another device that I have seen used to the detriment of a movie, not so here. Park is an artist with the camera. One sequence in particular stands out for me. The main character comes to a location that is familiar to him and important to a memory that he is trying to recall. As he recalls this memory he chases the memory of his younger self through the sequence. It is beautifully shot, we never lose our sense of time or place as can easily happen in such a scene."", """", ""The visuals and score are not the only positives in Oldboy. The narrative is gripping and tense. Our protagonist is on a mission of revenge for what has been done to him. We are along for the journey every step of the way. We feel every emotion that he is feeling as his story progresses. We feel his fear, torment, and hatred. Like all good revenge stories as he begins to reek his havoc we wonder at what cost it is coming. Are his motives pure, and even of they are is it worth the price it is costing his soul. Oldboy handles these themes masterfully."", """", ""I have two issues with this film. The first is I was never completely on board with the character of Mi-do. It is not a spoiler to say that we learn very early on that she has had a very similar experience to the protagonist. Despite this fact we are given she always seems to be much more aware than he is. He spends the film unraveling a mystery, she appears to understand most of what is happening but is just relying on him for protection from it. My second issue is the ending. While much is revealed in the last third and there are some very well done intense scenes, the last five minutes lacks the punch that a film like this needs."", """", ""Oldboy is an amazingly directed film that is well worth your time.

He stands out in this world, others are naturally drawn to his soft temperament and demeanor even if they don't realize the reason. Rocket does not readily have the means to rise above this world so consequently he comes across many stumbling blocks in his life. One of the more interesting sequences in the film is when Rocket concludes that he has no other options than to resort to the life most of his peers have. How this decision plays out results in some of the more lighthearted moments in City Of God. While Rocket's path may not be more interesting than others in the story, it is the most sympathetic."", """", ""Li'l Ze is the polar opposite of Rocket. He doesn't long to rise above this world, he longs to rule over it. The perverse crime and violence he sees all around him doesn't hinder him, it compels him. Li'l Ze earns the kind of respect that comes from brute force, and he learns these tactics at a frighteningly young age. If Li'l Ze is going to be a criminal he is determined to the most powerful criminal in the City of God. This is his only motivation, and what he allows to define his existence."", """", ""There are many other characters in City Of God. This film has lots of moving parts. However most of the other players move within the framework of the two main characters. Rocket and Li'l Ze are the black and white of the movie, while the other characters represent the shades of gray. It is an interesting way to tell a story, and works exceptionally well here."", """", ""If I have an issue with City of God it is with the way the movie was shot. We get very few static shots in this film. Everything is quick cuts and shaky camera. While this style never completely keeps me from enjoying a film, it can detract from my enjoyment some. It is very hard to get a sense of time and place when this style is employed, City if God was no exception to this. It also make it difficult to differentiate between the good and bad acting within this style. I suppose this can work positively for the director, but I still consider it a detriment."", """", ""Overall I would consider City of God a great crime drama.

I love the narration in this film, the poetry of of the narration against the story of this young man adds humor in almost every scene. There are also many great tender moments in this comedy. Ralphie's moment with his mom after beating up the bully, and his father giving him the bb gun at the end are my two favorite.

She feels like an outcast but soon realizes that the people in her life feel like outcasts for one reason or another and she sets out to do the things for them they will not do for themselves to make them happy. Unless you are heartless it will be impossible for you not to find Amelie endearing, and most of us can probably relate to her insecurities in one way or another. As Amelie works through her insecurities and tries to do something to make herself happy, as well as those around her, our fondness for her grows and grows."", """", ""The title character is not the only thing that Jeunet does well in Amelie.

An American Male meets a French Female on a train and asks her to spend the evening with him in Vienna. What is not simplistic is the wonderful characters, and exceptional dialogue in Linklater's film. It is obvious that Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) have a connection after their first conversation. As their day progresses their connection to each other deepens as does our connection with them. Before Sunrise is so special because we are not manipulated into connecting with them through tragedy, or violence, or sex. We connect with them as we do with people in everyday life, through the life experiences they share with us little by little as our relationship grows. This is true intimacy and is beautifully achieved here."", """", ""The intimate, personal moments that Jesse and Celine share throughout the film are sprinkled amidst a plethora of other conversations during their night together. They discuss everything from palm reading to dancing, the conversation is never boring and never unnecessary. They don't agree on everything and through that disagreement we we are invited further into their personalities as their connection grows. Jesse and Celine do interact with other characters in the course of the film. Linklater perfectly blends these interactions as well. The supporting characters add to the film without over powering the main characters. These characters are also just odd enough to further strengthen Jesse and Celine's connection as kindred spirits, without ever becoming caricatures."", """", ""Before Sunrise is a beautiful film. It made me want to rush off to Europe and spend aimless evenings wandering around foreign cities looking for romance. I suppose I will have to settle for revisiting this film and these characters in the future."" ]";8

Immediately after viewing this film I knew that it would be on my mind for weeks and that it would become one of my top 10 films. Every character in this movie is interesting on multiple levels. Every scene in this movie is thoughtful and poignant. The scenes that opponents of this film  have problems with, the frogs and the musical interlude, work for me in every way. Both these scenes do seem out of place in this story, but for me that is what makes them amazing. They come from nowhere, but interlock these characters in a visceral, interesting way. There is so much to unravel in a film this large, with multiple plot lines and characters running both separate from each other and together at various times.

A lot of critics had issues with some of the other characters in this film, specifically Dent. But once again i love what Nolan does with his villains.

I don't even think the character is poor, it is simply that Tarantino can not act.

What really sets this movie apart is Sorkin's rat a tat dialogue. From beginning to end the script is perfect and the star of the show.

The first scene in this movie is one of the best and most intense that I have seen in any movie...ever. The way that Tarantino can put together such a lengthy scene like this, packing a punch with the dialogue, the intensity, and developing his characters. In one scene we can see what kind of character Waltz will be through the entire film. Absolutely brilliant. The opening scene and the scene in the bar, which lasts probably half an hour by itself, are enough to make this one of my favorite movies. There are a couple points at which this movie drags just a bit, and this is what keeps it from being a perfect 10 in my opinion. In my estimation Tarantino has three movies: Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and Basterds, that show that he is a brilliant story teller, writer, and casts his movies flawlessly. It is a shame he cannot show these capabilities every time he makes a film."" ]";8

Led by the amazing Kevin Spacey, the performance of the whole is cast is just outstanding, and the plot shocked me, and had me in awe, at several points.

'Don't Breathe' is an exceptionally absolutely frightening film, triumphing with great direction and strong performances from the cast. It actually might be the scariest movie I've watched in recent years. I was tugging at my hair or sitting at the edge of my seat at each scene, and just when you thought we were out of the woods, the mother-effin' blind dude showed up right there behind you. I'd also like to show appreciation for the disturbing concept that turns out to be holding women captive only to make them surrogate mothers for the baby he longs to have after he lost his daughter. This film is truly the best go-to whenever you feel like having a bunch of back-to-back scares/meltdowns and a case of acute stress.

The most important factor is the performances. Ryan Gosling just gave it his all, and Emma Stone may have just reached the peak of her career (which she will last up upon with her pretty face and her funny persona). The soundtrack is dreamy and able to take you places. You will not stop smiling while watching this movie, take it from me. This film is gonna be in 10~20 years what Titanic or Shawshank Redemption or any Hitchcock is today. 10++++/10!"" ]";8

Once again, a VERY enjoyable movie, very inspiring. A must-watch!"" ]";8

It does occasionally cover some well tread ground but its wit, quirky style, and unbridled emotion overwhelm any complaints. To call the characters 3-dimensional is an understatement, and the performances are all just about perfect. It's without a doubt a movie everyone should watch. One of my favorite of the year so far without a doubt."" ]";8

It has the coolest production design I have ever seen and some of the cleanest, appealing camera work in recent memory.  The atmosphere is beyond thick, creating a hypnotic mood that just completely envelops you. Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac give Oscar worthy performances, but Gleeson isn't a slouch either. The plot is thought provoking, creepy, surprising, and buoyed by intelligent dialogue.  It was the best movie I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've ever seen for that matter."" ]";8
2109;foxcatcher;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""Foxcatcher is an engrossing, sometimes off-putting, but extremely well acted, memorable, and atmospheric movie.  With 3 great actors playing fully fleshed out and three dimensional characters, impeccable direction, and a compelling true story, I'm sure it will go down in movie history.  Many movies that tell a true story simply go through the motions, relying on everyone's recognition of the events to do the heavy lifting, but not Foxcatcher.  Bennett Miller directs it with tension, detail and cinematic flourish.  Steve Carrel proves to be a more than solid dramatic actor.  He's creepy, strange, and yet somehow still garners sympathy.  I'm not sure what his performance would seem like without all that makeup, although I'm sure it would still be more than adequate.  Ruffalo and Tatum are also great, and maybe even better than Carrel, but he does stand out more due to his odd and sometimes villainous behavior.  I also have to give props to the writers for creating a script layered with psychological intricacies.  All in all, a great movie, a great story, and a great showcase for its actors."" ]";8
2110;whiplash;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""Wow.  What an incredible movie is Whiplash.  It's just so engrossing, so well written, so intense, so good on every level.  It's also one of the best shot movies I've ever seen.  J.K. Simmons is absolutely amazing, and I can see why he swept all the supporting actor awards.  Miles Teller is also very, very good.  You're put right into his spot the entire movie, not literally, but through the direction and writing, you can feel every ounce of his character's anger and ambition. Out of all the best picture nominees from last year, I think this was the best.  See it as soon as possible."" ]";8
2111;dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""A massive improvement over Rise.  It's smarter, creepier, more intense, and directed with more inspiration.  Usually summer blockbusters, including this one's predecessor, have the air of a generic, factory made item.  Even the very good one's usually have this.  For the most part, Dawn lacks it, which is a very good thing.  The human characters have more depth this time around and the acting is more believable as well.  There are some scenes in this movie that are simply jaw dropping, especially the battle sequences.  The visual effects WILL at least get an Oscar nomination, unless either a miracle or giant pretentious snub occurs.  Dawn is more akin to the atmospheric and eerie movie that I wanted Rise to be.  Don't get me wrong, that was still a decent movie, but Dawn makes it look like crap in almost every area, except cgi.  This is so far the best movie of the summer and maybe even the best wide release of the year at this point.  Here's hoping for a Best Picture nom...  And one for Serkis too."" ]";8

The animation was stunning, the whole thing, from the screenplay to the action, was full of invention and creativity, and it's actually pretty profound and original to boot.  I loved the characters.  They're funny, very well voiced, and overall, endearing.  There's never a dull moment either.  The beautifully animated action is often both witty and exciting at the same time.  The ending, believe it or not, is extremely meta.  It's actually as deep a meditation on the human imagination, alternate realities, and separate universes as anything you can find in The Matrix, Inception, or Interstellar.  It's actually quite ambiguous too.  There are quite a few possible explanations for what was actually happening, and I'm sure you'll have them bounding around through your head once you see it.  This is as good as animated movies get and one of the best films of 2014 from any genre."" ]";8

Knowing that the story is true adds an extra layer of authenticity to an already hyper immersive experience.  Those criticizing it for honoring the fallen heroes of war have some serious issues.  A nearly flawlessly directed, elegantly simple, shockingly engaging movie."" ]";8
2114;american-hustle;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""American Hustle is a vigorously accomplished, and impressively stylized film.  It's funny, it's full of twists, and it's undeniably alive.  David O. Russell has absolutely perfected his directing style, and has cemented a spot among the top talents in the business.  The screenplay is just incredibly well written.  The actors are all either at the top of, or over the top of their game.  Nearly every performance is shockingly good, even by the standards of this ensemble.  The one I was most impressed with had to be Bale.  His character was so far removed from his usual roles that at times I just had to laugh in astonished disbelief for how strange it was to see him like this.  If I have any complaints about the movie they are few and far between.  In the first act some lines are hard to hear, and some scenes can get pretty skanky.  Other than that, it's great.  In 2013, which was one of the best film years ever, American Hustle just might have been the best movie of the year."" ]";8

It's characters feel more real and believable than any I can even remember, and the screenplay is keen on real life interaction.  The character development here never feels forced.  In addition to this the acting is basically flawless from the entire cast, and it's directed with extreme skill.  It's about as good as a drama of this breed can get.  I have a feeling that the natural gas companies paid off some of the reviewers so they'd review it poorly."" ]";8

For once a romantic comedy actually works.  You cannot label this movie as a chick flick.  It's too well rounded on every level.  It also defies clichés at almost every turn.  It's almost never mushy, or artificial.  The mental illness factor is very well integrated, and it truly captures the stress and pain that those people actually go through.  If the ending is pretty conventional, it's also completely earned.  It's funny when it wants to be, disturbing when it wants to be, and emotional when it wants to be.  One of the best movies of 2012."" ]";8

The ending may be morally confused, but from a critical standpoint I really can't find any flaws in the whole movie.  It's so poignant, so powerfully acted, and so well written that I'm going to go out on a limb and call it a true masterpiece.  Eastwood's direction is impeccable, and the film's emotions feel real, natural, and unforced.  The characters also seem like real people instead of just the usual cardboard cutouts.  I could go on forever.  This movie is great."" ]";8
2119;the-incredibles;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""Perhaps the best animated movie ever made.  It's actually more like an actual superhero movie than something you'd expect to come out of Pixar (not that their other movies are bad.) It's just written in a way that adults can relate to more than little kids can, which is a good thing.  The concept of a retired superhero who's tired of getting old is clever, and the animation itself is also really good.  I'd say it's definitely Pixar's best."" ]";8
2120;king-kong;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""A superb remake, and a thrilling adventure on its own terms, King Kong was one of 2005's most entertaining movies.  It starts out slow, with a very 1930's vibe.  I wouldn't consider the sections before the crew gets close to Skull Island great filmmaking exactly, but Jackson has made good choice not to rush the story.  Once they get to the island it proves that it was well worth the half hour wait.  Believable performances, for the most part incredible special effects, Jackson's expert direction, and real emotion make this a must own.  Granted, when I first saw the previews years ago I was hoping for a more surreal and out there vision of the story, but what we got was more than good enough.  Almost forgot to mention how great the movie's score was.  (That means the background music.)"" ]";8
2121;the-departed;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""A gritty, thrilling, intense, and intricately woven crime thriller.  Want to see what the big deal about Scorcesse is? Watch this movie, arguably one of the best gangster dramas of all time.  The direction is so tight and laser beam precise that I can't do it justice in writing.  The acting is all great, even though Nicholson does admittedly go a little too over the top in some scenes, and the story is engrossing and filled with consuming paranoia.  This is also a very excitingly violent movie.  Some will argue that there are too many Scorcesse-isms that we've seen too many times before, but I never felt like the story was just going through the motions or being anything other than authentic.  A great movie."" ]";8

Yes the action scenes are spectacular, but Hulk contains true psychological and emotional depth.  Lee's direction is amazing, and I'm truly glad that he decided to give the film an engaging story instead of rushing headlong into the clichés and poor characterization usually associated with the genre.  The fact that it was criticized by many for not having enough action shows how juvenile their tastes truly are.  It's a great accomplishment.  Leaps and bounds ahead of the reboot with Edward Norton."" ]";8
2123;twelve-monkeys;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""This is one thought provoking, disturbing, and ingeniously constructed film.  It may have even inspired Looper, but I found this film both superior in style and plot.  Terry Gilliam always creates strange, disorienting worlds.  When I first saw Brazil I really didn't like it at all, but I might have to watch it again after viewing 12 Monkeys.  The performances are all incredibly convincing and strange.  Willis gives perhaps his most mortal and desperate performance, and Pitt goes full retard as a crazy animal rights activist, showing that he possesses an acting range which I thought he lacked.  I don't want to spoil things, so I'll just say that the plot needs to be paid close attention to at all times and it will definitely keep you on your toes.  If you're a fan of sci-fi or mindbender films at all then you need to see this creepy and unique vision."" ]";8
2124;signs;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""An eerie, suspenseful, emotionally touching near masterpiece. With a great cast giving great performances, a witty, brilliant, and extremely detailed script, and some expertly sensitive direction, this may be Shyamalan's best movie. It's such a shame that he had to go into such a downward spiral. I truly hope he gets his mojo back because his first 3 films (this one especially) were just brilliant. Signs will scare you senseless because Shyamalan knew how to build the suspense slowly and effectively, with hints of menacing creatures, not guts and gore. The incredible score by Newton also adds layers of astonishing depth onto the already touching story and nuanced performances. A classic, plain and simple. Its reputation will only grow as time goes on."" ]";8
2125;minority-report;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""A truly great movie hindered by a couple of minor flaws.  First and foremost this is one of Spielberg's best movies, and I can't believe it only received one Oscar nomination.  Better than none, but still.  The movie is thought provoking and should be watched more than once in order to soak everything in better.  The unique bleached look to the film is just about perfect, and the futuristic world of the film is impressive.  It has moments of true emotion and the acting is just about flawless as well.  It's only flaws are that the last couple of minutes weren't that great, and some of the cop on the run action wasn't as engaging as it should have been.  Not that no action was any good, it's just that some big moments fell kinda flat.  These are just nitpicks however in a film destined to be remembered as a classic.  It's one of those rare movies that actually uses an ambitious premise well throughout the entire film and not just the beginning."" ]";8
2126;the-dark-knight;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""The dark knight is one of those very rare films that transcends its genre.  It's more like an actual crime thriller than a comic book movie.  It's dark, well acted, at times unerving, and probably as close to reality as a superhero movie can be.  Nolan's direction, especially in the action department, is nearly impecable.  The cinematogrophy is also excellent.  As everyone who seen this knows, the best part of the film is Ledger's joker.  It's probably the most disturbing  take on a familliar character ever devised.  However, I due have some nitpickings.  If you've seen the crow you know that Nolan has borrowed a few elements from that film including the look of the joker.  One other small problem is that when Bale is dressed as Batman in a scene where he is just talking to someone it seems kinda silly, especially with that voice he makes.  Also, in my opinion, Maggie Gyllenhol, (I think that's how you spell it), is too ugly for her role.  But ultimately the film is so far ahead of its superhero movie counterparts in terms of screenplay, directing, acting, and cinematogrophy that these things don't leave much of a negative impact.  It's a film that everyone needs to see, even people who can't stand other films in this genre."" ]";8
2127;forrest-gump;10;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""A timeless and beautiful movie.  Forrest Gump is truly a modern epic.  It's hilarious, heartbreaking, sometimes breathtaking, and completely unforgettable.  The scope is impressive.  Never does the movie feel slight or insignificant.  It encompasses the entire human emotional spectrum, is impeccably acted, especially by Hanks, and it contains some of the most memorable characters in film history.  At the risk of sounding too overjoyed, it's an absolute classic.  Forget the cynics and their campaign against anything emotionally touching.  This is one of the greatest films of all time.  It's an accomplishment that has stood the test of time and shows no sign of aging."" ]";8
2128;the-green-mile;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""A emotionally powerful, miraculously acted, exceptionally written, and unique drama.  The direction is incredible.  Darabont gives the film a vivid sense of place.  You are completely absorbed when watching the Green Mile.  All the actors rise to an incredible level of convincingness, and the prison feels like an actual place.  The supernatural scenes also pack a punch, and some other scenes could make a robot cry.  It is pretty long, and not for people with a low tolerance for graphic violence, but it's without a doubt a great movie."" ]";8

It's tense, eerie, violent, bloody, action packed.... I could go on forever.   This is probably my favorite Cohen brothers movie.  They direct it with such obsessive detail in every little action that it's impossible not to be impressed with their work here.  I like a lot of their movies, but none of them can match this one's sublime mix of violence, story, and character.  Anton Chigur has to be one of the top five screen villains of all time.  He really does come close to Hannibal Lecter status, and how often can you say that?  The only real flaw here is an unsatisfying ending, but I've seen plenty of movies that have ended a lot worse.  Probably one of the best Best Picture winners ever, and perhaps my favorite crime thriller."" ]";8

I've been putting off watching this movie forever, thinking it was going to be boring and sappy.  But it's far from it.  This movie wraps you up in its story and it always feels very real due to superb filmmaking.  The acting couldn't get any better, and in the end this is one of the most uplifting movies ever made.  Yes it's very long, but it without a doubt justifies its length."" ]";8

Did I mention that the production design is incredible and that the score also fits perfectly?  Even Keanu Reeves' performance isn't terrible, which is almost impossible.  If you like sci-fi at all the chances are you'll love this.  But I'm willing to bet you already do."" ]";8

Meticulously directed, and written with searing intelligence, this is very likely the best horror film ever devised.  Of course, Hopkins as Hannibal Lector is simply amazing.  He's still the gold standard for the movie villain (even though he's kind of the hero), and I doubt he'll ever be surpassed.  There are so many fascinating, creepy, and even disturbing aspects about the relationship between Starling and Lector, but I'll let you find this out for yourself.  The characters here are as nuanced as I've ever seen.  Foster's performance is also excellent.  I must warn you, it's a graphic, disturbing, and at times even disgusting film, and on a different note some of the technical aspects of the movie haven't aged so well, but all in all, it's so memorable and haunting that I have to call it an absolute horror/crime classic.  I'll admit, I've had nightmares where I was in a building with Hannibal on the loose.  Those were some scary dreams."" ]";8

You'll feel great empathy for Truman throughout the whole movie.  He's a great character.  It's a great movie.  It's a classic."" ]";8

The first time I watched this movie I liked it, but did not love it.  It takes a few repeat viewings to truly pick up on just how surreal of an atmosphere Nolan has devised through innovative plot structure, Hanz Zimmer's incredible score, and impressive cinematography, even if you understood the story.  I would give his cinematographer's name, but even though I know it, I know I'd spell it wrong.   I've heard the movie Paprika had a great influence on Inception so I don't quite know exactly how original it actually is, but rest assured, it's definitely unique among mega budgeted action films.  With it's arthouse sensibilities, huge scale, impressive visual effects, ambiguous ending, and enough (possibly) pseudo intellectuality to give Freud a headache, Inception marks a new era in blockbuster filmmaking, and will permanently cling to the deep recesses of your mind."" ]";8

It's an incredible debut for both its director and its lead actor.  It was modestly budgeted but still managed to have some of the best visual effects around. And it's all held together by a lean, politically charged, and well realized script.  It even gets you to feel sad for the aliens.  It could have used less F bombs, but it's still a great movie, and it deserved all of its Oscar nominations.  It also deserves a decent sequel."" ]";8

The world of Pandora is as detailed and alive as any setting you'll ever find in a movie, and quite possibly even more so.  The story may have been done many times before, but it's still very engaging.  There are moments that are powerfully charged with emotion, the direction is flawless, and the scope and scale are both breathtaking.  There is also an extremely resonant atmosphere throughout.  James Cameron has created what is quite possibly his best film.  It's an instant classic, full of deeply human and resonant emotion, groundbreaking visuals, and viscerally stunning action.  My only real complaint is that the dialogue can be somewhat clunky, but the rest of the movie quickly sends this to the realm of nitpicking.  Please choose to watch this instead the next time you even think of checking out one of the lousy Transformers sequels."" ]";8

I'm not sure if the black and white coloring was a necessary adornment, but it's still very well shot and the movie never looks old.  The world these people inhabit is so well fleshed out that you can't help but be drawn in by it.  The story is an amusing and sometimes touching one, and it ends on the perfect note.  Some people addicted to fast paced action might hate it, but in terms of writing, acting, direction, and tonal consistency, it's quite an accomplishment nonetheless.  MacGruber! Haha, get it?

I'm almost certain Sandra Bullock will win an Oscar.  If it doesn't win the visual effects Oscar I'd also be very surprised about that.  I do have some caveats however.  The story felt too minimalistic for me.  It's basically a survival tale set in space.  There's nothing wrong with that but just think of what could have been.  Despite these problems the movie is so tense, so atmospheric, and so visually impressive that it would be crazy to not catch it in theatres.  I'd place it up there with Avatar, District 9, and Inception."" ]";8

It's always engaging and you'll never be bored with the outside the box ways Matt Damon adapts to his situation.  It's perfectly paced, has a great cast, and is unusually fun for Scott.  It really didn't even feel like a Ridley Scott movie, because in terms of mood and tone it's the antithesis of the darkness from Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator... to almost any Scott movie.  I don't think it's as good as Alien.  I don't think it's as good as the rapturous, and profound Interstellar, but it is one of the best and most enjoyable movies of the year and will go down as another Ridley Scott sci-fi classic."" ]";8

It does the latter extremely well. The cast is uniformly strong, but Stallone's nuanced performance, arguably the best he's ever given, is the real standout. The movie also has a gritty, real world style in its direction, excellent writing, and an engaging story. One of the best movies to come out of 2015."" ]";8
2142;interstellar;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;"[ ""Make no mistake.  Interstellar is an amazing, emotionally resonant, and thought provoking movie.  I just didn't find it as perfect as the first time I watched it.  The acting is all Oscar worthy.  The great cast performs all of the deeply emotional moments with absolute perfection.  You may definitely cry.  This is also one of the most visually stunning movies ever made, containing breathtaking sequences of pure awe and wonder, the best of which is a cerebral and heartbreaking trip into a black hole near the end, but I'm not going to spoil anything for you.  Upon my second viewing however, I realized that there could have been a couple more of these types of moments placed into certain parts of the film.  The drama is all very well executed, but sometimes the movie does go a little too long without any action.

Rey, Finn & Han are the major players and they all have a spectacular chemistry and surprisingly much humor. We experience wonderful development of both old as new individuals, and the acting performance of this diversity-friendly flick is five-star worthy! One character’s fate is a big event in this film. Some of you might find it like a smart move meanwhile others just find it like a bad one. I think it gave the film a brand new future.

The second time I saw this film though, made me look at Rey's and Kylo's flaws in a much less critical way. There're hints throughout the film that might give an inside to why they are as they are.

I believe it was his way of confession, it was his way of acknowledging the wrongs he'd done and paying for the sins he'd committed. He hurt everyone around him too much, to forgive himself.

On the contrary, the part of the movie that I found most emotionally frustrating was my inability to comprehend Stevens (Brilliantly played by Anthony Hopkins) and his line of thought. But Anthony Hopkins clearly apprehends who Stevens is at his core and who he's trying to be.

Miss Kenton (played by the impeccable Emma Thompson), the new housekeeper, unintentionally ignites the hidden fires within Stevens, of which he knew nothing about. Both fell for each other, neither prepared to take the first step. Not much happens in the remains of the day but whatever does happen, is felt intensely.

Tommy Lee Jones opens the film with a monologue where he talks about how criminals have changed (or dare I say evolved) to a point where he no longer understands them. The film draws attention to this idea through the character Anton Chigurh. He's a criminal who'll outrightly kill anyone who brings him inconvenience. But Chigurh's a much more complex character. Although it's never quite revealed why he wants the satchel of money, one can reasonably argue that he wants it because it would aid his survival (same can be said for Josh Brolin's Lewellyn). But what makes Chigurh different is that he believes following the rules and morals set by society don't really help you survive. Rather they're shackles. Chigurh's morals are decided by the toss of a coin. He'll kill an innocent person who's brought him no inconvenience only if the coin permits. In other words, Chigurh believes in a random and chaotic world and for the most part it seems as though he's the person who decides others' destiny through chance. But the Coens make it clear that Chigurh is no divine/ supernatural figure. He too is subject to random events (as witnessed when he crashes his car). But how do you categorise a person like that? A person who is so dispassionate and mechanical but still believes in an ideology (or a lack of ideology). He's not a nihilist. Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff doesn't get it. He doesn't want to chase a killer he doesn't understand. He doesn't want to be some hero, he just wants to retire before something hazardous happens to him. The genius of No Country for Old Men lies in the way it escapes banality and tightens its grip as it progresses. By the time its over, you'll be all out breath feeling as though you've just spiralled into the seventh circle of hell. It pulls you out not by heroism but by capitulation."", ""At the beginning, Tommy Lee Jones is askes himself - how do I make sense of a crazy, violent and unstable world that has lost all its bearings?

Nolan wants us to take a good long look at the brutally bleak streets of Gotham and reflect on its striking perspicuous similarities to our own post 9/11 world.

There is not a single character in this film that goes through some kind of character arc. The minor changes they undergo are left obscure and there are no hints as to what brought about those changes. None of the characters are likable. The entire film almost is a passive observation of this family's uneventful progression through the years. Although that worked very well in the first half of the movie the second half seemed superfluous. It brings back some of the most overused cliches (honestly if I had a nickel for every time a movie showed the divorced dad as cool and buff and the divorced mother as the complete opposite). The kid actors are great but as they age they seem less and less convincing. The dialogue as well suffers from cranky and mawkish moments. And on top of all that it lacks lacks a narrative structure. If you look at the Tree of Life, which is just as unstructured, Malick took advantage of that and turned it into a meditation on human behavior. Boyhood didn't even attempt to achieve anything of the sort. Tree of Life was poetry; Boyhood is just product.

Bruce Dern gives an effortless performance as a cranky old coot with one attention-seeking foot in the spotlight and the other half-buried in the shadows of utter dementia. The interpersonal conflicts among family and community, past and present are presented in a simple, linear uncomplicated way.

Lies and illusions are necessary to prevent a lonely, inconsolable reality from setting in. And while Alexander Payne manages to keeps things relatively upbeat to prevent dragging us down into a pit of futile despair, he also fails to fully develop and realize the themes he puts forward. Every time Payne rustles up a movie (Sideways, The Descendants) he gets high praise, and this time he almost deserves it. He's a fairly astute cinematician who wants to make meaningful pictures without getting in too deep. Specifically, road movies on half a tank. Thankfully, he doesn't tread into murky Bergman territory, or puff his stuff up with Goddard-like self-importance, but he doesn't do himself much justice by avoiding or brushing off the potential worth and urgency of the matters he introduces. His concepts are cut short. While I'm watching Nebraska, I can't help but wonder how adept filmmakers like Kieslowski or Cassavettes would have treated and serviced the material.

I saw about 15 minutes in that these characters were actually very well versed and perfectly cast and not listening to their real voices only made the full experience suffer. It's a rare occasion when you are so intrigued by a movie that you don't even mind reading subtitles the whole time. It was beautiful. I was so relived to watch this movie utterly dispel the Twilight perimeters of a vampire romance movie. Feels good. It creates a feeling of something dark and mysterious and brooding taking slow step after step into the shadows. The scary aspect was more in the disturbing reality of being a vampire than anything else. The development of the love between Eli and Oskar is bloody and odd but convincing. I really like how Oskar is not exactly a geek or nerd in appearance, just on the weird side, who when pushed in the right direction, becomes strong and assertive.  I like how Eli is not particularly a give away as a vampire. She appears initially to be a normal innocent girl with a few weird tendencies, but even in her real element as a vampire, who needs to drink blood to live, doesn't carry the demeanor of a killer or maniac. She just does what she has to, while not really enjoying it. And linking them together with genuine love for each other, without conditions or anterior motives is just...awesome.  These characters are just so well defined and seeing their love unfold was definitely a treat. Instant favorite."" ]";7

In the modern age, when everything is run on a computer, a crazy smart computer hacker maniac has no one to stop him should he ever decided to oh, I don't know, dissolve the whole system...right? Wrong. The good old hard hitting cop, John McClane is obviously aged but no less fierce and heroic. It was a bold far-fetched plot but maybe not too far fetched. McClane had to commission a nerd to help him which proved a great move considering their dialogue and character differences. Then you throw in the Taken angle where McClane is trying to repair his relationship with his daughter, and this is just an awesome movie. Sure the stakes are as high as they get and so are the stunts, but even when he went up against pretty impossible odds i didn't think anything stepped too far out of bounds considering what happens in other action movies. Bruce Willis played within himself. They brought in a few attractive women. They made sure the bad guys were plain bad guys. This got a higher score because it proved it could remain a rock solid action film even when they downplayed the blood and foul language comparative to the others. Well done. Worth a watch."" ]";7

Boxing is a sport that tends to show up in movies a lot but that is only because it has so many metaphorical connotations and digs at our own willpower to be fighters in our own lives, which is personified in this film. It's a different angle considering the fighter is a female. It gives more room to broaden the audience and be a significant and entertaining stand point for both guys and girls.

Its a remarkably simple story but with the right tweaks it became its own monster. Like if you had your own personal horrors locked away in your head, room 1408 would slowly and sadistically put you to death with them. Its heavily weighted on one character's personal struggles. Which is gutsy in a lot of ways but it was well done. This wasn't a jittery, jumpy, bloody, or even crazy type of scary, this was a sad hollow and empty type of scary that we hope we will never have to experience.

A sphere of pure power and evil is coming to destroy earth and only the four elements, earth, wind, fire, and water, (powers confined in sacred stones) combined with the fifth element or supreme being can stop it. The back story to the plot and the overall delivery this movie has stands as one of the most unique views on the future I've ever seen. No one will be able to do it like this one. There was a quirkiness that every single character had and it all fit into the mold perfectly. Gary Oldman sharp as always. A good balance between action and humor without losing the emotional and dramatic tone. Solid movie. It didn't get a 10 because I felt like the love interest between Korbin and Leeloo was lacking in development and since that plays such a major role, I felt that could have been focused on a little closer, maybe an extra scene or two of them bonding and what not...but an all-time favorite for me and worth a watch."" ]";7

Quite ambitious to make a movie about a worm hole, even more so that the human race depends on what is on the other end for survival. My mind was blown, such a large scale with very rich and deep emotion for each character. The grandeur and the detail supersedes anything I've ever seen before.

As “Inside Llewyn Davis” opens, the title character, a folk singer in Greenwich Village, holds a Gaslight Cafe audience spellbound with a hushed, perfectly studied rendition of the traditional tune “Hang Me, Oh Hang Me.” The year is 1961, when the Village folk scene was on the verge of transforming from a hermetic community of purists to a tourist destination where dilettantes could gawk at commodified Beats and their “new ethnic” successors. The adamantly uncommercial Llewyn is having none of it, preferring the scuffed patina of unassailable — and impoverished — artistic purity."", """", ""As embodied by the gifted actor and singer Oscar Isaac in a poignant, mesmerizing breakout performance, Llewyn emerges as an improbably sympathetic anti-hero in “Inside Llewyn Davis,” written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen in a tender, startlingly straight-faced departure from their established house style of cool, ironic distance. Not that they’ve entirely abandoned their signature sharp edges and jokes confected like cookies full of arsenic: “Inside Llewyn Davis” is full of lacerating, often profane speechifying, much of it darkly funny and most of it directed at the long-suffering, compulsively self-sabotaging Llewyn, who sourly returns the verbal abuse in kind."", """", ""That bitterness notwithstanding, an unmistakably forgiving, even wistful air pervades “Inside Llewyn Davis” that feels new to the Coen canon, an abiding compassion that elevates their protagonist from an object of derisive pity to an avatar — not just of his own era, but of ours. Like so many of the characters in movies this year — from Bruce Dern’s bereft retiree in “Nebraska” to Tom Hanks’s “Captain Phillips” and Robert Redford’s nameless sailor in “All Is Lost” — Llewyn Davis can see that his era is passing, threatening to make him a casualty in its inexorable wake. He’s smart enough to see that the times are a-changin’. He’s self-aware enough to know that he won’t be changing with them."", """", ""But for the few days depicted in “Inside Llewyn Davis,” he at least struggles, if not always valiantly. In a series of encounters with family, friends, ex-lovers, fellow musicians and impresarios, Llewyn — who is loosely based on the late folk singer Dave Van Ronk — is put through a classic test of character, with every impulsive choice sealing his ultimate fate. Navigating an archipelago of narrow corridors and fusty downtown couches, Llewyn argues with a sometime friend, Jean (Carey Mulligan), who with her husband, Jim (Justin Timberlake), is part of a wholesome folkie duo; he sits in on a session for a tacky novelty record called “Please Mr. Kennedy”; he alienates well-meaning Upper West Side supporters and early-music fans. He cadges a ride to Chicago, where he hopes to audition for club owner and manager Bud Grossman, tone-perfectly portrayed by F. Murray Abraham, whose pronouncement “I don’t see a lot of money here” reverberates in his empty club like the clang of a descending guillotine."", """", ""That road trip west could have been scripted by Jack Kerouac himself, Llewyn’s car mates consisting of a self-important jazz musician and pompous pontificator, played with suitably wheezy grandiosity by John Goodman, and a vaguely Neal Cassady-esque driver played by Garrett Hedlund, who conveniently played Cassady in “On the Road” just last year. (Real-life folk figures Tom Paxton, the Clancy Brothers and Peter, Paul and Mary are evoked even more explicitly in the Coens’ script.)"", """", ""Throughout the journey, Llewyn keeps playing, with Isaac lending his assured, clear voice to such folk standards as “Fare Thee Well (Dink’s Song)” and “The Death of Queen Jane,” often in their gratifying entirety. (The music was arranged and produced by T Bone Burnett.) As diverting as Llewyn’s travels are, and as revelatory his encounters with the eccentrics and charismatic oddballs (we haven’t even mentioned the cat yet), it’s pure sensory pleasure that vaults “Inside Llewyn Davis” into the pantheon of great Coen Brothers movies, from Bruno Delbonnel’s wintry, desaturated cinematography to the music that rings with high, lonesome longing and regret."", """", ""“Inside Llewyn Davis” lends itself to near-endless exegesis and interpretation, from its atmospheric excavation of the insular, occasionally overlapping worlds of 1960s New York to authenticity as both fetish and Olympian ideal."", """", ""This soulful, unabashedly lyrical film is best enjoyed by sinking into it like a sweet, sad dream.

After early ambivalence over his responsibility for the Ring, Frodo grows into the job; after long dodging his royal inheritance, Aragorn finally rises to the occasion; Sam, especially, emerges as a three-dimensional character of intense devotion to Frodo even after he has been tricked by the Iago-like Gollum and exiled by his closest friend; and the ineffectual Hobbits Pippin and Merry take on some size, figuratively if not literally."", """", ""The building sense of dread is palpable. With the belching Mount Doom and its all-powerful hovering Eye in the distance, humankind and Orcs alike traverse an already stark landscape that will shortly become scorched. Dreadful giant screeching dragons, called Fell Beasts, flap down out the sky to pluck hapless soldiers off their feet and horses. And the Orcs are assisted by yet more monsters, including Hulk-like Trolls and towering, long-tusked mastodons known as Mumakil, that strike terror and make resistance seem futile."", """", ""With these forces massing to decide the fate of civilization, Gandalf tries to buy time for Frodo to plunge the Ring into the lava at Mount Doom. To greater effect than he has at any point in the three films, Jackson cuts among different sets of activity, the most spectacular being the battle and the most emotionally intense being Frodo’s painful, inch-by-inch journey."", """", ""The siege of Minas Tirith may well be the mother of all cinematic battles; certainly no pre-CGI war film ever featured a scene involving upwards of 200,000 soldiers. But that’s how many Orcs maraud the city, and the details are extraordinary: the huge stones catapulted at the fortifications from mobile towers; the fire-breathing dragon battering ram that crashes through the main gates; the earth-shaking Mumakil that raze all before them with scythe-like tusks and carry dozens of men; the gradual movement of the battle from the ground to the upper levels of the exquisitely designed citadel. All of “The Lord of the Rings” has been building to this, and it delivers entirely."", """", ""All the outstanding technical and craft achievements that have been duly honored in the previous installments are at least equaled and sometimes trumped here, especially in regard to how involved the creatures are this time.

I became quietly astounded when I realized that this movie was going to create an original, interesting relationship involving a teenager and a hooker.

Are we supposed to like these self-obsessed, homicidal maniacs?

The script has Clarences initial drug-hawking meeting with Elliot take place, unremarkably enough, in a zoo, but the director wanted something with a little more pizzazz, so he set the sequence on a rollercoaster. Tarantino is overstating the case when he compares Scott to undervalued auteurs of the past (Douglas Sirk he aint), but theres no doubt he was perfect to orchestrate this wild ride."", """", ""This is not only an immensely entertaining violent action but genuinely romantic at times.

To watch this movie (whose 2 1/2 hours speed by unnoticed) is to experience a near-assault of creativity."", """", ""The multi-plot story, whose almost-Escherian design becomes apparent as the movie progresses, is too involved to outline. Essentially, the film’s a narrative circle of interconnecting, time-jumping episodes, in which various pulp-fictional gangsters, molls and palookas deal with bizarre occurrences in their lives. In the end, everything comes together in a multi-ironic Tarantino reverie. The never-a-dull-moment drama is propelled by its crazy-casting dream team: Samuel L. Jackson is unforgettable as a philosophical killer who quotes Ezekial before his ritual executions. Uma Thurman, serenely unrecognizable in a black wig, is marvelous as a zoned-out gangster’s girlfriend. Bruce Willis is a pug-faced charm as an aging boxer who refuses to throw a fight. And who knew John Travolta would produce the sweetest performance of his career as a good-natured goon?"", """", ""As with his “Reservoir Dogs,” Tarantino delves into the working-stiff world of crime. For the characters in “Pulp Fiction,” killing, stealing and breaking fingers are merely occupational banalities. Partners Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth discuss whether to keep robbing liquor stores or stick up all the customers in the sandwich shop they’re eating in. (They carry on like a married couple making a mutual career decision.)"", """", ""Hoodlums Travolta and Jackson—like modern-day Beckett characters—discuss foot massages, cunnilingus and cheeseburgers on their way to a routine killing job.

In one of the movie’s most harrowing sequences, Thurman has a drug overdose and Travolta—stuck with babysitting her for his boss—has to perform improvisatory surgery. It’s horrifying and oddly funny. As Travolta and drug-dealer Eric Stoltz attempt to revive her with the help of a medical book, the movie enters some out-there combination of Sam Peckinpah-style gruesomeness and “I Love Lucy.”"", """", ""Tarantino, an L.A. video store clerk-turned-auteur, was raised on filmic bloodletting. Screen violence, assimilated secondhand from such films as “Straw Dogs,” “The Godfather” and “Scarface,” is his most immediate reference point. But he transcends himself by putting brutality in quotation marks, making it traipse hand in hand with absurdity. It may be that, with “Reservoir Dogs” and “Pulp Fiction,” Tarantino has over-mined his muse. Should he make another work remotely like either film, he’ll run the risk of rendering his work commonplace. But for now, his material is witty, ironic and inspired—although the irredeemably squeamish should know to stay away. In “Pulp,” you’ll see what it is to clean up a car spattered with brain gore. But you’ll also see an amusing Harvey Keitel, as a freelance clean-up man (dressed as if for a prom) supervising the icky proceedings. In the film’s most exhilarating showpiece, Willis undergoes an extended, hair-raising suspense ride that includes sword violence, rape, gunfire and torture. After the most brutalizing experience of his life, Willis returns to his girlfriend, who promptly starts crying.

Written by John Ridley and directed by Steve McQueen, it tells the true story of Solomon Northup, an African-American freeman who, in 1841, was snatched off the streets of Washington, and sold. It’s at once a familiar, utterly strange and deeply American story in which the period trappings long beloved by Hollywood — the paternalistic gentry with their pretty plantations, their genteel manners and all the fiddle-dee-dee rest — are the backdrop for an outrage."", """", ""The story opens with Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) already enslaved and cutting sugar cane on a plantation. A series of flashbacks shifts the story to an earlier time, when Solomon, living in New York with his wife and children, accepts a job from a pair of white men to play violin in a circus. Soon the three are enjoying a civilized night out in Washington, sealing their camaraderie with heaping plates of food, flowing wine and the unstated conviction — if only on Solomon’s part — of a shared humanity, a fiction that evaporates when he wakes the next morning shackled and discovers that he’s been sold. Thereafter, he is passed from master to master."", """", ""It’s a desperate path and a story that seizes you almost immediately with a visceral force. But Mr. McQueen keeps everything moving so fluidly and efficiently that you’re too busy worrying about Solomon, following him as he travels from auction house to plantation, to linger long in the emotions and ideas that the movie churns up. Part of this is pragmatic — Mr. McQueen wants to keep you in your seat, not force you out of the theater, sobbing — but there’s something else at work here. This is, he insists, a story about Solomon, who may represent an entire subjugated people and, by extension, the peculiar institution, as well as the American past and present. Yet this is also, emphatically, the story of one individual."", """", ""Unlike most of the enslaved people whose fate he shared for a dozen years, the real Northup was born into freedom. (His memoir’s telegraphing subtitle is “Narrative of Solomon Northup, a Citizen of New-York, Kidnapped in Washington City in 1841, and Rescued in 1853, From a Cotton Plantation Near the Red River, in Louisiana.”) That made him an exceptional historical witness, because even while he was inside slavery — physically, psychologically, emotionally — part of him remained intellectually and culturally at a remove, which gives his book a powerful double perspective. In the North, he experienced some of the privileges of whiteness, and while he couldn’t vote, he could enjoy an outing with his family. Even so, he was still a black man in antebellum America."", """", ""Mr. McQueen is a British visual artist who made a rough transition to movie directing with his first two features, “Hunger” and “Shame,” both of which were embalmed in self-promoting visuals. “Hunger” is the sort of art film that makes a show of just how perfectly its protagonist, the Irish dissident Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender), smears his excrement on a prison wall. “Shame,” about a sex addict (Mr. Fassbender again), was little more than glossy surfaces, canned misery and preening directorial virtuosity. For “12 Years a Slave,” by contrast, Mr. McQueen has largely dispensed with the conventions of art cinema to make something close to a classical narrative; in this movie, the emphasis isn’t on visual style but on Solomon and his unmistakable desire for freedom."", """", ""There’s nothing ambivalent about Solomon. Mr. Ejiofor has a round, softly inviting face, and he initially plays the character with the stunned bewilderment of a man who, even chained, can’t believe what is happening to him. Not long after he’s kidnapped, Solomon sits huddled with two other prisoners on a slaver’s boat headed south. One man insists that they should fight their crew. A second disagrees, saying, “Survival’s not about certain death, it’s about keeping your head down.” Seated between them, Solomon shakes his head no. Days earlier he was home. “Now,” he says, “you tell me all is lost?” For him, mere survival cannot be enough. “I want to live.”"", """", ""The genius of “12 Years a Slave” is its insistence on banal evil, and on terror, that seeped into souls, bound bodies and reaped an enduring, terrible price."" ]";9

When Phoenix’s character, Theodore, takes advantage of the latest upgrade, he finds that his computer is now being run by a charming, Siri-like disembodied voice that calls itself Samantha."", """", ""Given beguilingly peppery voice by Scarlett Johansson, Samantha loses no time in seducing the lonely Theodore, who composes heartfelt notes-for-hire at a company called beautifulhandwrittenletters.com, by nights amusing himself with escapist video games and raunchy phone sex. Samantha’s circuitry is sophisticated enough to intuit and evolve according to Theodore’s feedback, so it’s no surprise when he starts to fall in love with her (er, it). What’s surprising is that Jonze has taken what could easily have been a glib screwball comedy and infused it instead with wry, observant tenderness and deep feeling."", """", ""Then again, it’s not that surprising. Jonze, after all, brought similar sensitivity to “Being John Malkovich,” “Adaptation” and “Where the Wild Things Are.” But “Her” is something special even for this gifted director’s idiosyncratic oeuvre. Jonze has always possessed a meticulous, curatorially expressive visual sense, and here his talents are particularly sharp: He films Los Angeles in neutral tones of blue and gray, with pops of bright red (including Theodore’s shirt) providing startling slashes of contrast. That sensibility extends to his clever, even ingenious script, in which he builds an utterly convincing interior and exterior world for Theodore and Samantha to inhabit. Unlike “Ted” or “Minority Report,” each of which has something in common with “Her,” Jonze’s film doesn’t make the comedic conceit or technology the focus. Rather, he’s interested in alienation (like so many of his filmmaking peers this year), and the role that projection plays in constructing love, desire and identity itself."", """", ""Theodore and Samantha exist in a city full of people being alone together, a familiar backdrop at a time when it’s common to see four people share a dinner table, their eyes glued to four iPhones. So the prime obstacles that inevitably emerge in “Her” aren’t what you think they’ll be, and the movie winds up being continually more surprising as it follows its quirky, often amusing, course."", """", ""Phoenix has effectively banished the bearded eccentric he was playing on the talk show circuit just a few years ago; mustached and bespectacled, he delivers a quietly heroic, even Chaplinesque turn as an Everyman contemplating the nature of the self and the soul that lies within. At its core, “Her” is about listening, and both Phoenix and Johansson — who delivers an astonishing vocal performance — make that experience anything but passive."", """", ""Theodore joins a crowded gallery of protagonists — most of them male — who this year have been battling loneliness and isolation on screen; “Her” may be the most intellectually inquiring of these smart, observant movies, as Jonze teases out what’s genuine emotion and what’s just programming. “Her” occurs in what Jonze calls the “slight future,” but that’s clearly a question for the ages."" ]";9

Because War For The Planet Of The Apes,aside from being the best movie of this rebooted extravaganza,has shown me things i didn't expect a reboot could do,and that is being a magnificent,if not also emotional,conclusion of the trilogy. The story is probably one the more serious i saw in a long time,with unexpectedly poignant moments and some of the most remarkable action scenes of 2017. With each passing year,the motion capture gets phenomenal every time,and so does this one,being a little bit more detailed. The acting was terrific: Andy Serkis as Caesar is strong as always,Woody Harrelson as the nefarious Colonel is,well,nefarious,and luckily,Steve Zahn as Bad Ape didn't ruin the movie. You could have some funny moments here and there,but honestly,i expected worse. And let's not forget about the astounding score by Michael Giacchino...I can talk for hours about that piece of musical wonder. I was also impressed by how the cinematography worked in this movie. In the end,if you thought Logan was the best movie of the year,well,you can think again. War For The Planet Of The Apes is a delightful conclusion to an already solid trilogy,with breathtaking visual effects,an unexpectedly dark and poignant story and a score by Michael Giacchino that puts the webhead in silence (and that will probably become part of your nightmares...)"" ]";8

Well sir, luckily it's not like that. It's not even better than the 1995 animated flick, but you can see how hard did they work to bring you such a great expirience (like The Angry Birds Movie). You can see from the story that they changed something from the anime, and some of them are impressive, even though i didn't expect some creepy imagery in some scenes. From a visual/sound effect standpoint, we're talking about a cybernetic version of Avatar, because the way they create the city and its minimal parts was like they were saying to you \""This is what we can do with CGI now!\"". Everyone was complaining about ScarJo being The Major instead of a Japanese/Asian actress, but in the end, the final result was pretty good (and also a demonstration that she is not only the Black Widow we all know and love). The soundtrack was the only thing that was actually better than the anime. After LEGO Batman, Lorne Balfe returns to the ring alongside Clint Mansell to make what could be the greatest score of 2017 (for now). In the end, Ghost In The Shell didn't want to be like the Anime, but instead, it wanted to be an upgraded version of the generic action movie, with a promising story, some mind-blowing visual/sound effects and some great acting."" ]";8

Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart did a great job in acting,the story was impressive and cool in the 1st and 2nd act,then there's the 3rd act,where the movie gets emotional (and you'll probably shed a tear,even if this is a comicbook movie). From the trailers it seemed weak,but the R-Rating in this movie was brutally great (maybe a bit more than Deadpool). This movie could not be Oscar-Worthy, but Marco Beltrami's score has a chance of being nominated,because that's some epic levels of emotion right there. In the end, best comicbook movie of the year? You can think again! Logan is not only that, but it's also the best X-Men movie since X2 and Days Of Future Past, with a dark and emotional plot, great levels of acting and an epic score that signs a farewell to the X-Men franchise."" ]";8
